<h2 id="#about">About this Course</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>With the general introduction of JavaScript in the first course, this
course will focus on JavaScript libraries, specifically jQuery. The
scripts will be geared toward <span class="showme">Document Object Model (DOM)</span>
manipulation. Learners will describe the top JavaScript libraries and
differentiate which would work best to implement and accelerate
development of web page animation.</p>

<p>Course objectives include being introduced to the end product of the
course – a landing page style website using jQuery elements to
manipulate HTML documents and enhance user experience. Diving deeper
into the landing page that will be created and break it out into
individual jQuery projects. jQuery events and effects will be covered
while exploring more jQuery's relationship with HTML documents. Finally,
a focus on plugins and continue to breakdown jQuery's ability to
manipulate HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Introduction to jQuery, a little bit of history.</p>

<p>JQuery was originally created by John Resig in 2006, and it became the
most popular JavaScript library and it's still a popular JavaScript
library. In a recent survey, it was found that over 80 percent of
websites are still using jQuery. It's less popular today than it was
back in the early 2010s where it was at its height. But it's still an
important tool to learn and good to know.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 04. jquery advantages (09) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image004.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:40%"
  title="jQuery Advantages"
  alt="jQuery Advantages." />

<p>There are some specific advantages that came with jQuery when it was
invented and some of these advantages exist today, but they are somewhat
diminished, but let's talk about them. First of all, it smoothed out the
differences between browsers. Back in 2006, when jQuery was invented,
JavaScript was not implemented evenly across browsers and jQuery was
really great at smoothing out those differences from one browser to
another. It also simplified common tasks such as traversing the <span class="showme">DOM</span>. It
provided a lot of ways of getting elements on the pages that we didn't
have with plain JavaScript back in the late 2000s, or early 2010s.</p>

<p>It also provided an easier to work with event model for capturing clicks
and scrolls and other kinds of events that users might use in the
process of working with the page. Events that users make trigger. So it
provided this event model that was easier to access and easier to use,
it was easier to create interactive scripts that could hook into that
event model in jQuery.</p>

<p>jQuery also provides an effects library that's very easy to use and
really exciting and it's really a cool effects library that provided a
great way into programming, into creating interactive elements for a
whole generation of developers.</p>

<p>Then on top of that, there's a plug-in system for additional
functionality. You could create plugins that added functionality to
jQuery and we'll take a look at this to some extent.</p>

<p>Then finally, last but not least, jQuery provides a simpler syntax and
that allows us to write shorter and more concise scripts and these were
all huge advantages to jQuery and contributed to making it the most
popular JavaScript library.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 05. jquery is less useful than 2010 (10) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image005.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:40%"
  title="jQuery is less useful now than in 2010"
  alt="jQuery is less useful now than in 2010." />

<p>Today, jQuery is less useful than it used to be back in the early days.
Some of the things that have been smoothed over is that, remember, in
2009, jQuery came out in 2006. In 2009, the standardizing body decided
to make JavaScript, the scripting language for the web and at that
point, a lot of excitement poured into the JavaScript world and there
was a concerted effort from the people who were making browsers. Web
browsers like Chrome and Firefox and Safari and Internet Explorer at the
time, It's now Edge. But for those companies that were making those,
whether it's Apple or Microsoft or whomever, to standardize their
implementations of JavaScript, that really helped with the development
of JavaScript plus the release of ES6 or ES 2015 in 2015 really helped
with a lot of the features of plain vanilla JavaScript so that we don't
need as much from jQuery as we once did.</p>

<p>We don't need to smooth out the differences between different browsers
as much anymore. The implementations in different browsers are pretty
much the same now are very similar, we don't need a lot of that anymore.
In terms of simplifying common tasks such as traversing the <span class="showme">DOM</span>, we've
already explored <span class="showme">querySelector</span> and 
<span class="showme">querySelectorAll,</span> which
are great tools for accessing elements in your <span class="showme">DOM</span> that are built into
plain JavaScript now. Those have really helped minimize the need for
jQuery to do that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Also in plain JavaScript, we now have the <span class="showme">addEventListener</span>
method, which is great for adding event listeners for all different
types of events that users might trigger or might be triggered by the
system. Using that event listener model limits the need for the easier
to work with event model that jQuery had to offer. The <b>effects</b>
library is interesting. The jQuery <b>effects</b> library is great, and
it's really great to work with and it's fun to work with, and it's still
useful from time to time.</p>

<p>But these days we would much prefer to use CSS to create animation
because CSS will take advantage of the devices GPU, the graphics
processing unit, as opposed to the CPU, the central processing unit, and
that will make your animation smoother and work better, especially for
older, slower devices, and these kinds of things. Phones, older phones,
this kind of stuff that the jQuery animations will feel a little bit
clunky because jQuery is using JavaScript to create those animations.
The effects library is not as useful today as it once was, although it
can still be useful.</p>

<p>The two things that are still really useful about jQuery are the plugin
system for additional functionality. There are thousands of plugins
written for jQuery and we'll look at a few of them. But you can explore
many on your own and the wonderful thing about plugins is that, other
people have written a whole bunch of code and you can take advantage of
that and build all kinds of cool things from the code that others have
written. That also helps prepare you for other types of libraries of
code, if you get into node and NPM and these kinds of things. Doing this
stuff with jQuery will help prepare you for that world.</p>

<p>The simpler syntax for shorter, more concise scripts is also still true.
It's perhaps less true than it once was, but it's still true. You'll
see, we'll do some exercises and some examples where you'll see that the
scripts are shorter and more concise and if you're just learning
programming for the first time, that can be a way into programming. It
was a way into programming for a lot of people who got into JavaScript
and jQuery back in the day. It certainly was for me personally, where I
wanted to do something that was fun and interactive and I could write
fewer lines of code with jQuery than with JavaScript, so that was a real
bonus for me as I was learning JavaScript back in the day.</p>

<p>There are a lot of modern considerations to take into account when
deciding whether or not to use jQuery. Adding JQuery to your project,
add some weight to the files, and they'll take longer to load. If you're
just doing one simple small thing, it's probably just not worth it to
load jQuery to do that. However, if you want to get a simple interaction
working quickly and easily, or if you want to make use of a jQuery
plugin, using jQuery could save you a lot of time and really be
worthwhile. You have to really consider it on a project-by-project basis.</p>

<p>In programming, a library is just a file with a bunch of functions in
it. Or it could be multiple files that you link up to your project. In
this case, you link them into your HTML file and then you can just use
those functions. If you're not familiar with a lot of programming and
you haven't done a lot of this kind of thing, it may seem like an
unusual or a new concept for you, but just think of it as something as
simple as that. It's just a file with functions in it that you can
access and use in your project. And then once you've linked it to your
project, it's just a matter of finding out what those functions are and
how to use them. And that's really how jQuery works. It's a file that
you can add to your project, and when you do you have access to all the
jQuery functions and all the functions that come along with jQuery.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. two options for plugging in jquery (13) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image008.png?raw=true"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Two Options for Plugging in jQuery"
  alt="Two Options for Plugging in jQuery." />

<p>There are two options for plugging in jQuery. The <b>first</b> is you
can download the file, the actual jQuery library file, and put it in
your folder with your other Javascript files or other files for your
project, and then link to that file locally in your project folder. And
then when you load your web page it will load that file along with all
your other files.</p>

<p>Or, <b>second</b>, you can hot link to the library on a CDN or Content
Delivery Network. So what that means is instead of putting the file in
your project folder, you're actually linking to the file already out on
the Internet. And a CDN or Content Delivery Network means that when you
do that, you'll actually be getting the file from the closest server to
you. A CDN has servers all over the globe. And when you go to load a
particular web page, it's looking at your IP address and figuring out
where you are and then getting the file from the closest file server, so
it will get it the fastest that it can.

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>First, we'll look at downloading jQuery, and to do that, you can go to
<span class="showme">jquery.com</span>, and I have that website pulled up here, and you can
click the Download jQuery link. So let's go over here. And I can click
on download jQuery here. And that will take me to a page that, if you're
not used to doing this kind of stuff, will look a little confusing.
because we've got a whole bunch of links here and it's not really clear
exactly what it is you should actually be downloading. And then they've
got this stuff with npm and Yarn and Bower, and this migrate plugin and
all this other stuff on the page. So it can be a little bit confusing.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 11. downloading using npm, yarn and bower (14) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Downloading using npm, yarn, and/or bower." />

<p>The <span class="showme">npm, Yarn</span> and <span class="showme">Bower</span> are all build tools that you might
be using if you're in a particular environment that's using these build
tools. But we're just going to download the actual library file itself.
And what we want is the compressed version. There will be a compressed
version and an uncompressed version.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="JavaScript code within jQuery." />

<p>The uncompressed version will look like this, and it looks kind of
like Javascript that you've seen before with <b>var</b> and all this
kind of stuff. The compressed version is going to remove all of the
white space and sort of compress it down. So it's not really made for
human reading at all, it's made just to be loaded on your computer. But
it will be smaller. It'll be a smaller file to download and so what you
want is the <b>compressed</b> <b>production</b> version of jQuery.</p>

<p>So if you click the shortcut to the compressed version, you'll get a
screen full of compressed code which appears as jQuery version 3.7.1.
Okay, so to download this, if you just right click in the white area
here and do Save As, and I'm going to save it in my Downloads into my
jQuery Start folder, and that's where you should put it as well. So I'm
going to just put it in here and save this so that now I have a copy of
jQuery in my jQuery Start folder here.</p>

<p>Here it is, jQuery 3.7.1 min because the minified version has been
compressed down. And, you want to get the minified version. This version
is the size of maybe a medium sized image on your web page (86
kilobytes). It's not that big. This is significantly larger (un-minified
version of 279 kilobytes).</p>

<p>So now we've got <span class="showme">jQuery</span>, let's get it plugged into our HTML
file. We'll plug it into our HTML file here.</p>

flavors of <b>jQuery</b> that include different features. The version 1X
snippet is the oldest version of <b>jQuery</b> and it's loading 1.12.4.
This is really the 12th major version of version one, essentially, and
then we've got version 2.2.4, which is the second major version, and
that version they did a number of things to remove support for IE6, and
finally, version 3.7.1 which is the current version of jQuery.</p>

<p>The most recent version, the version that we downloaded is version 3.7.1, so

<pre>&lt;script src=" 
&lt;script src=&ldquo;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Then go back to our file here, and paste that line in instead, and you'll see 
if we save this and come back and do testing <b>jQuery</b>, <b>jQuery</b> is loaded.

<p>Now if I was gone, but this will work just fine because it's actually

down, it's not going to load it, but if the internet's down, and you
going to get to your webpage anyway.</p>

<p>It's a little bit easier to use the CDN to load <b>jQuery</b> because
it's just one less file and I have to download, keep track of. Usually
we will be using this method to load <b>jQuery</b>, and there are times
when you might want the older versions generally will use the newest
version, but you might want the older versions if you're using a
function or method in <b>jQuery</b> that has been deprecated, or if
you're using a plug-in that was built using an older version, and it
needs some functionality from the older version in order to work. But
generally we're going to use the newest version of <b>jQuery</b>,
version 3.7.1 at the time of this recording.</p>

<p>If we come back over here, we can get rid of this if-else statement.
Just delete that for a moment and let's put in a <b>jQuery</b>
statement. Try this instead. There we go, dollar sign, we're going to go
get the <b>h1</b> on the page, which is this element here, Is
<b>jQuery</b> working? We're going to use the CSS method in
<b>jQuery</b>, like that. What we're going to do is we're going to set
the color of the <b>h1</b> to red. If we just do this one line and then
save it.</p>

<p>Then if you come over and run this test in <b>jQuery</b> again,
you'll see that it turns the <b>h1</b> red here. If I inspect this
element here, you can see that what <b>jQuery</b> has done here is it's
set the style color red on the <b>h1</b>. Now before we did the same
thing with <b>querySelector</b> or <b>querySelectorAll</b>. We've done
this kind of thing before in previous lessons, but now we're using
<b>jQuery</b> to do it. In <b>jQuery</b> you can see we have just a
simple syntax here that uses CSS-style selectors to access elements on
the page. We've gotten methods that we have access to because the
<b>jQuery</b> library is plugged in that we can just use. Now if you're
wondering about the dollar sign here.</p>

<p>The dollar sign is just a shortcut for the word <b>jQuery</b>. I could
put the word <b>jQuery</b> there, and over here this will run just
exactly the same way. It will work fine with using the word
<b>jQuery</b> instead of the dollar sign (<b>$</b>). But generally we
use the dollar sign as a shortcut just because it keeps our script
shorter, it's less typing, and why type all those extra characters if
you can just type one? We can put the single dollar sign in there for
that reason. This CSS method here is just one of the great many that
<b>jQuery</b> has to offer that will help us factor web pages.</p>

<p>You can come back here, you can go and look at the <b>jQuery</b> API
documentation here. You can see that there's just tons and tons of
different methods that you have access to as we go through and look at
all of these.</p>

<p>Here's the CSS one that we were just looking at, but there's tons of
them in here. <b>jQuery</b> gives you access to all of these different
methods. It's like having a kit that you can use to build things for
your web pages just by plugging them in and plugging in <b>jQuery</b>
and then using these methods, in accordance to the way they're described
in the documentation. Let's try something else here. If we come back
here and try, let's try adding a few paragraphs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Basic jQuery Syntax - Working with Collections"
  alt="Example, Basic jQuery Syntax - Working with Collections." />

<p>Let's just add a few paragraphs. One of the nice things about
<b>jQuery</b> is it allows you to work with collections of things. If I
come in here and just add a couple of paragraphs to the page. I'm just
going to copy that and paste it and add a few more here. Now I've got
three paragraphs on the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Script to change paragraph color to red"
  alt="Script to change paragraph color to red." />

<p>Down here, if I change this to <b>p</b>, if we were doing this with
plain JavaScripts, we would need some loop because we would do
<b>querySelectorAll</b> or <b>getElementsByTagName</b> or some method
like that, which would give us an array of items that we would then have
to loop through to turn them all red. We've done that before. You've
done that in some of our previous lessons. Here with <b>jQuery</b>, one
of the things that makes <b>jQuery</b> shorter and more concise is it'll
work with groups of elements.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>I can just grab the paragraphs and say CSS color red. You'll see over
here when I run this page, it's loading these paragraphs and it's
turning them all red without having to do a loop. That saves me a few
extra lines of programming. This is the thing that makes <b>jQuery</b>
easier to get into for people who are new to programming. This whole
thing of having to, I take this array. Now I've got an array and I'm
going to loop through it. It's a little bit of a pain. <b>jQuery</b>
takes some of that pain away, and that's really a nice feature of
<b>jQuery</b>.</p>

<p>If we go look to this page here, you'll see that it just has some
content in it with some different markup with the header in each one in
each to summon ordered lists. It's got some ideas and some classes and
some links and some other content that we can access.</p>

<p>And one of the beautiful things about <b>jQuery</b> is that you can
access any element on the page, usually in many different ways. It's the
very powerful part of <b>jQuery</b> and you can think of it as the query
part of <b>jQuery</b>, you're finding elements on the page that you can
do things to them or with them or for them. We will be using
<b>jQuery</b> to go in and access elements on this page and we'll
practice, what some of these different methods are and some of the
different things we have available to us.</p>

<p>For example, if we were to try to do this, we could go back to our file,
we're going to have to add the, at the library again so we need the
script here.</p>

  alt="Add script shortcut to jQuery min library." />

<p>If we come back over to our file, you'll notice the bottom, we don't
have any script tags. So down here after this closing div we need to add
the <b>jQuery</b> library, so we can use <b>jQuery</b> and then we need
to use then we need a script tag, which we can open and close.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Add red border to main element"
  alt="Add red border to main element." />

<p>And now if we wanted to do something like put a border around this main
element here, we can very easily just use <b>jQuery</b> object. And type
it this way it'll get, there is still some syntax that you have to get
used to with <b>jQuery</b>, so I recommend typing it this way, so you
can kind of get used to it. If you do pound main and then CSS the CSS
method that we've already talked about and we're just going to do a
border here. Border 2px solid red.</p>

<p>If we do that and save this document here, and then come over to our
example page, so here's my page and if I refresh you'll see I get a
border around the main area of the page. So that's working, so we can
access this element, we can access all kinds of elements with
<b>jQuery</b>.</p>

<p>If I wanted to get the elements on the page that have the class
<b>special</b>, if we go back to our code here, we should see that we've
got a class <b>special</b> in these two list items. We've got a class
<b>special</b> up here on this list item, so these items should be
targeted if we change this to not <b>special</b>. And one of the things
that's nice about <b>jQuery</b> is that if you just know CSS then how to
get these selectors.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Test, red border around class special." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>It's just using the same selectors you'd use in CSS, so I can come over
here and try that again and you can see those elements are getting the
border around them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 43. example, jquery - compound selectors (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, jQuery - Compound Selectors"
  alt="Example, jQuery - Compound Selectors." />

<p>You can also use compound selector, so if I wanted to get specifically
the age to inside of main we can do that as well so we can do main H two.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 44/45. set & test red border to main, h2 (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  alt="Test, red border in main and h2 elements." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Now this may not seem so special now because we have query selector
and playing javascript which allows us to use compound selectors like
this using the CSS index. You can get to these elements, easily inside
of our page and you notice I don't have to do any kind of looping. So
even if I was using plain javascript, even now with query selector, all
I would have to have some sort of loop or for each method or something
like that, to go through and turn each one of these red. Whereas in
<b>jQuery</b> I can very simply just grab the group and apply the CSS to
it and applies it.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 46. red border around main, h2 (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:50%"
  title="Again, set border to red around main and h2 elements"

<p>So this thing returns a <b>jQuery</b> object, with these elements inside
it and then we can apply that CSS to it.</p>

  alt="Example, Try These!" />

<p>There are more that you can try, so for example you can try Multiple
selectors, like I could say I want the H two and the paragraphs. I
recommend trying these out I'm not going to make you watch me type them
all. I could get the even list items, or the first paragraph or the list
item that has an a northern list inside of it or a list item that
contains the word three. So there's like all of these different ways of
getting, content on your page. Now some things to pay attention to is
that, <b>jQuery</b> does change over time and some of these that I have
on this slide are deprecating now.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is, when you have a page and you have some
elements, you need to get to be creative, use the documentation for
<b>jQuery</b> to help you find the best way of getting to that element
on the page.</p>

<p><b>jQuery</b> has its own special syntax for event handlers. So let's
take a look at how to do that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 50. $('a').click(function() (34) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>If we come back over to our test page here, you can just comment
this, I already deleted just to get rid of it. But I'm going to target
anchor tags on the page. So again, I'm going to type my <b>jQuery</b>
object, and in there, I'm going to say <b>a</b>. That's going to go in
and target all of these <b>anchor</b> tags on the page, all of those and
all of these, and that's going to gather all those items and return them
in this nice little <b>jQuery</b> object here. I'm going to add a click
handler.click.</p>

<p>So this click handler is going to fire when you click on any one of
those anchor tags, and what I'm going to pass in, make sure you type it
this way, so you typing from the outside in. I'm going to add in here a
function like so with parentheses and curly braces. So this is an
anonymous function. This is a function that's just going to run when
this click handler happens.</p>

<p>In here, I'm just going to put <b>console.log</b>, and in here, I'm
going to put <b>this.html</b>. That should put in the console the HTML
of the link that I clicked. Because it's going to put this in all of the
links, I can only click one link at a time.</p>

sub link one, or if I click link two, I get link two, link four, I get link four.</p>

<p>The thing to keep in mind is that <b>jQuery</b> is just plain JavaScript. It 
isn't a separate thing from JavaScript, it isn't a separate language, it is just 
JavaScript and you can mix in regular JavaScript with <b>jQuery.</b></p>

<p>In summary, you've learned a lot of new stuff. You can plug
<b>jQuery</b>, like plugging the <b>jQuery</b> library either by
downloading the library and putting it in with your files or you can use
the <b>CDN</b>. You can use <b>jQuery</b> to capture events and to
affect elements in the <span class="showme">DOM</span>, there's a lot more to learn, but this
is a good introduction to what <b>jQuery</b> does. It's just more
JavaScript, but it makes doing some things a little bit easier, and it's
still important to learn actual native, regular, plain vanilla
JavaScript, especially as the need for <b>jQuery</b> in new projects is
reduced.</p>

<p>But if you get a job and you're working on a project, it's very
likely that you'll be working with Legacy code and you'll encounter
<b>jQuery</b>, or if you're looking around on the Internet, you're very
likely to come up with solutions that are <b>jQuery</b> specific.
Because it's been such a popular library, it's going to be around for a
long time, and it's still important to learn how to work with it.
Learning how to work with <b>jQuery</b> will help you learn how to work
with JavaScript, so it's a two-way street.</p>

<p>In this project, we're going to have a simple page and on the side of
the page, we have a menu, and when you click the menu item, it falls
down and shows the sub-menu. When you click a sub-menu, well, one is
already opened, it will close the other ones, that will limit the number
of options your user has to see, and sometimes that can be really
helpful for users in terms of cognitive load, you only want them to see
a certain number of options at once.</p>

<p>Just a few notes about the markup. If you look at the markup, you'll
notice that the article comes first and the aside comes second. This is
often important for search engine optimization, we want the important
content further up the page. We'll use CSS flexbox with row-reverse to
display these next to each other, but put the navigation on the left.
Generally, we want the article higher up on the page. Also notice that
the navigation is following a very common markup scheme inside of a
menu. This embedded, unordered list goes entirely inside the list item
for the parent item. This is important to get in HTML.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>I have my page open and you can see the article comes first right after
my main section opens there.</p>

<p>Then the navigation is an unordered list with list items, but notice
this list item is entirely enclosed in the parent list item. This is
important to get right, and a lot of web developers get it wrong. The
only items you're allowed to have is children of the ordered or
unordered lists of list items. This unordered list needs to be entirely
enclosed in this parent list item.</p>

<p>That gets us started, and we're using just a little bit of CSS here as
demonstrated on the styles to display flex for this main element, but
use flex-direction and row-reverse to get the navigation on the left and
the main content on the right. Now, with all that in place, let's get

  title="Example, Basic Strategy; show/hide menu"
  alt="Example, Basic Strategy; show/hide menu." />

<p>The basic strategy of the script is that the sub-menu will be
initially hidden, and then when you click on a parent menu, it will show
the sub-menu. This will be accomplished by having JavaScript swap these
two classes on the sub-menu when you click the parent menu.</p>

<p>Initially, the sub-menus, the unordered lists that are inside the list
items that are inside the unordered lists, don't have the hide-menu
class on them. Our first challenge is to write a loop that adds this
class to all the sub-menus in the unordered list.</p>

<p>You'll see over here in the styles that these two styles are already
here. Hide-menu, display: none, and show-menu display: block. Your first
challenge is to write a little script, down here we've got script tags.
See if you can write a script that goes in and applies that sub-menu to
that hide-menu class. We want to apply that to all of these unordered
lists so they have class hide-menu on them. See if you can do that, and
when we come back in the next lesson, we'll see how I did that.</p>

<p>Down here, I'm just going to make a variable, var <b>submenus</b>. Then
assign that to <span class="showme">document.querySelectorAll</span>, and what I want to get
are the <b>ul, il, ul</b>. There we go. Because what I want are these
unordered lists that are inside the list items that are inside the
parent unordered list. I'm going to get these, all of these and put them
in here, and then I just need a loop for <b>var i equals 0</b>, i is
less than submenus, dot length, i plus, plus, curly brace. Now here what
we need to do is to put that submenu on each of these. I'm going to say
submenus dot square bracket i. Each one of these, it's going to go
through each one of these and then do <b>className</b> equals hide menu.
Over here it's hide menu. Hide menu, display name, and that should go
through and put that class on all of those elements.</p>

<p>Let's see if I did that right. Over here I'll go check my document here,
and this is exactly what I did, <b>className</b>, hide menu. Let's see
if that actually works. We save that, come over here and refresh the
page and look at that. All those menus are hidden, they're set to
display none. I could do "Inspect," and you can come in here and see.
Click on this menu here or this one of these, one of these menus you can
see it's got hide menu on it. Let's get that class on there. That's
working great.</p>

<p>Your next challenge is to add a click handler to the main links.
These links here have a class on them of menulink. We want to gather
those, and when you click on them, we want something to happen. We are
going to need an event handler for that. For now, just pass the event
object and prevent the default behavior from that would result from
clicking the link. But see if you can do that on your own without
looking at my solution. But we'll do it together in the next lesson.</p>

<p>So we'll get those document in there, and then we need to loop. Used
your loop here, so we need a for var i equals 0, or i is less than menu
links.length, i plus plus. Hopefully you're getting used to writing
loops now. Then in here we're going to put an event listener on each one
of these. So <b>menulinks[i].addEventListener(’ click’, function(event){
event.prevenDefault(); alert(“clicked!”); });</b> When you click, we're
going to run an event unit run a function. Not run an event, we're going
to run a function. We've got this function here that runs. Then for
right now all I want to do is pass in the event property, event object
there, and do <b>event.preventDefault</b>.</p>

<p>But I have an event listener for each of these, and you can test it by

<p>The next thing to get into is this keyword in JavaScript, and if you've
looked up stuff on JavaScript online, you can find that you can find a
lot about this keyword. It can be pretty confusing. But in the context
in which we're going to use it in this course that this keyword is
fairly simple. It basically means that the <b>menu</b> that we clicked
on, we've add an event listener to all the menus.</p>

<p>Now when you click on one, we get an alert. But you can only click on

<p>I'm going to make a variable here called <b>thisMenu</b>, and I'm
going to assign the keyword <b>this</b> to it, which means
<b>thisMenu</b>, the one that I clicked. Then I'll
<b>console.log(thisMenu.innerHTML)</b>. You'll see that we can actually
get the HTML of the menu that we collect. Let's do that over here.
Instead of an alert here, I'm going to say <b>var thisMenu</b> = this
keyword. That means it refers to the thing that was clicked.</p>

<p>Then we could do either console log or we could do to learn. I'm just
going to do an alert. Since we were working with alert, alert
thisMenu.innerHTML. Instead quotes here because this was JavaScript not
construe thisMenu.innerHTML. Alright, thisMenu.innerHTML, let see with
architects. When I click this menu, I get an alert that says Menu 1.
It's telling me what's the inner HTML of the menu that I clicked. Now we
can get this menu using this keyword.</p>

<p>But really what we want to get to is the parent ordered list. Over
here we've added a click handler onto when you click one of these links.
But really what we want to get to is this list item. So that ultimately
we can get down into the unordered list inside of here. The next
challenge is now that we know, which menu we've clicked on, we want to
get to the unordered list inside that menu item. In other words, what we
want over here is we have something that tells us that we've clicked on
this anchor tag.</p>

<p>But really what we want to get is this unordered list here, because this
is the unordered list we added the class, hide menu to. Now we want to
change the class to show menu. In other words we need to get from this
link down here. The way we do that is through the parent. We can find
out, who is the parent of this item. Then on that parent do query
selector to find the unordered list that's inside the parent list-item.
See if you can do that part on your own, going into to try to do that
challenge on your own, and then on the next lesson, I'll show you my

want to really get to this UR, so, down here what I did instead of just
this, I can do this dot parent node, parent node dot query selector. You
will. And that should get me, the actual on ordered list, that's in the
parent of the anchor tag that I clicked on. The parent is the list item.
So I'm going up to the parent list. I have been looking for the UR
that's inside that will start them, and let's leave this. We'll leave
this alert here. But you can make it console log if you prefer. It

this whole an ordered list that I'm getting here. It might be easier to

I click on this, it shows the menu. Now, you'll notice we're not quite
done yet because if I click another one, it'll show that menu and it
doesn't close the previous menus. We want to be able to open the menus
and close them. The reason we want to make it so that when you click on
a menu, if there's another one that's opened, it will close it before it
opens this menu.</p>

<p>That's the next thing that we need to figure out how to do. But this
little piece of the script is pretty simple here. We have a menu that's
using this keyword that says, ''Go and get the parent node, go get the
unordered list inside that parent''. The parent would be the list item.
Go get the unordered list inside the list item, and then change the
ClassName from "hide-menu" to "show-menu". That seems pretty
straightforward. You got this answer here. We can open the pages and we
can open the menus, but we can't close the menus.</p>

<p>The next challenge is if the menu has the class set "hide-menu", set it
to "show-menu", otherwise, set it to "hide-menu". This is your
challenge, is how to make it so that it actually functions properly.
There are two methods that you can use to help you with this. There's a
method called classList and there's contains that will help you figure
out whether the menu has ''hide-menu'' or ''show-menu'' wanted. See if
you can do it on your own. Then if you are successful or not, just come
back to the next lesson and we'll see how I did it.</p>

<p>Were you able to get the answer to this challenge?</p>

<p>It's a little bit trickier because this one required you to look some
stuff up. We haven't used class list or contains before. So hopefully
you went to the MDN, the Mozilla Developer Network which is the
authoritative resource on these types of technologies, and looked up
something like element classless to sort of see how it works. And it
gives you some examples on here. Also there's another page contains and
so you can actually find contains contains. Does the dog token list and
returns a boolean if true. So token list contained so we can combine
these two things together to make this work. So let's try it together on
our code over here and if you are able to get to work that's great. If
not this will help you out.</p>

<p>So instead of this I'm just going to comment that out. Or you could just
delete, but in there we're going to put an if statement if. And what
we're going to check for is if this menu.classlist.contains. And we're
going to look for hide menu like that. So if this is going to return
true or false, does it contain hide menu? If it does contain hide menu
then we're going to do this. But in there, else if it doesn't contain it
then we're going to do this. But we're going to do hide menu. And that
will allow us to open and close the menus. Let's save this and come back

we can still open multiple menus and what we want is to be able to make
sure all the other menus get closed. Any other menu that's open is
closed. We can reduce cognitive load on our user and they can they can
open only one menu at a time, and be sort of presented with only one set

hopefully my explanation helps. But I recommend if you're not getting
these challenges, I recommend going through this lesson a few times to
the point where you really can't do them without looking at my answers.
It will help you learn javascript and so much more. Okay, so your next
challenge should not be a too difficult one. But basically what we need
to do is close all the menus and then run this if statement. So before
this, if statement happens this if else even happens. We want to loop
that closes all the all the menus. So see if we can add a lip that
closes all the menus before showing the sub menu with the parent menu
being collect.</p>

the menus get closed when you click on one that you're opening. And
we're going to leave the if statements if you're clicking on one to
close it, it will still work. And if it's set to class named
<b>show-menu</b>, it'll cited to <b>hide-menu</b>. That's why we want to
leave the if statement here.</p>

<p>And if we go over and take a look at it and test this, we should see
that this is working now. So I come back here and refresh this. Now when
I click on a menu it opens, but when I click another menu it will make
sure that one is closed and then it will open this one. Plus I could
click on menu to and close it. So all of the functionality is now
working and it's looking pretty good.</p>

<p>The next challenges, since we're using this loop twice, we're using the
loop here as well as up here. And we don't really want to repeat
ourselves. So now you're challenge is, how could you make a function
that contains this loop and run that function twice? We want to run it
once when the page loads and run it once down here inside the if
statement. And the function could be called something like hide sub
menus or something like that. And, yeah, so see if you can make that
function and make that work. And in the next lesson, we'll look at my
solution for how I made it work.</p>

<p>Everything is working and we can leave the script the way it is. But
it's always good to refactor your code and make it better if you can.
Let's do that with this final step here, this next step here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>We're going to come over here and we're going to make a function, we're
just going to put it here, function hideSubmenus, like that. I'm going
to move this loop so it's inside that function. Hopefully, you were able
to do this on your own. Tab that in. Now, I've got a function called
<b>hideSubmenus</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 97. script, hidesubmenus (61) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Script, hidesubmenus"
  alt="Script, hidesubmenus." />
  
<p>I need to run that function here and run it once here and then I'm going
to run it again down here. It just makes the code a little bit more
readable because in here, I can see if it contains hide all the submenus
and then show this particular menu. Otherwise, if this one doesn't have
class list hide menu on it, said it's a hide menu and that should
actually work.</p>

<p>So let's just test that really quickly, make sure that that works the
way we think it should work. Back over here and refresh the page and you
can see that it's still working just the way I intended it to work.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you came up with the exact same solution that I came up with
and we're able to get it to work the way I was able to get it to work.</p>

<p>The last challenge for this is just to apply our best practices steps
that we've learned earlier in the course. Hopefully, you can do that on
your own. But what we're looking to do is to put the script and do to a
separate file, add the IIFE, the immediately invoked function expression
closure, add the use strict directive, change all the variable
declarations to const or let.</p>

<p>We're using let, if the variable changes like inside the loop over here,
this needs to be let. Then link the script to the head of the page and
be sure to add the differ property inside the script tags so that it
loads after the actual content of the page is loaded. So see if you can
do all of that and then come back to the next lesson and see if you are
able to get the same answers.</p>

<b>script.js</b>, that makes sense. Then on this file I'm going to add
my <b>IIFE</b> immediately invoked function expression, with the
parentheses and in there at function. The function has its own
parentheses in its curly braces. Then we add an extra pair of closing
parentheses there. Then we're going to click inside of here, down in it

<p>We can take all of the stuff from here (lines 69-97), cut it, and
paste it inside <b>script.js</b>. Now we just need to go through and
clear up our function declarations and change this to <b>const</b>. Down
here, because we're going to loop, this needs to be length, this
<b>var</b> needs to be <b>let</b>. Then down here, this can be
<b>const</b>. Sometimes it's nice to have your main variables all up at

<p>We save that file back here and an <b>index.html</b> file. We'd get rid
of these script tags from down here, bottom of a page. Instead we can
put them up here in our head. Script <b>SRC =“script.js”</b> set it to
defer to the close script tab. Then always of course, go back and test
it to make sure that you didn't screw something up. You can open the
menus, you can close the menus.</p>

<p>For this project we'll use <b>jQuery</b>. We did this exact same project
using plain JavaScript in the previous lesson. But now we're back to
where we started with just these menus folded out and we want to do the
whole same thing again, except using <b>jQuery</b>.</p>

<p>This will be a really great way for you to see the difference between
<b>jQuery</b> and JavaScript, using plain vanilla JavaScript.
<b>jQuery</b> is JavaScript, but the syntax is slightly different, and
you'll see how much shorter this script is when we get done with it, and
how easy it is to do this interaction using <b>jQuery</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>Yeah, we're going to do the exact same thing. The only thing that's
different about the start file in this case, is that it includes a link
to the <b>jQuery</b> library on the CDN.</p>

<p>Down here at the bottom of the file, this is the only thing that's

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Hiding the Submenus"
  alt="Example, Hiding the Submenus." />
  
<p>First thing we're going to do, is we're going to set all of those
initial list items to not display. In the previous version of this
project, we had some classes set up for Hide menu and Show menu. But
here we're going to use the <b>CSS</b> property to set display to none.
We'll see an even easier way in just a minute.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 114. ul li ul display: none (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image114.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="ul li ul display: none;"
  alt="ul li ul display: none;" />

<p>But let's do this first so you can see what it does. Down here, I'm
going to use my <b>jQuery</b> object, and write it like this from the
outside. I'm going to use my <b>jQuery</b> object like that. I'm going
to use quotes to say go in and get ul, li, ul. This is the unordered
list that's inside the list item that's inside the unordered list.
That's these list items that are inside these unordered list items that
are inside this unordered list. I'm going to do, ''display: none''.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 115. test inspect console ul style display none (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image115.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test Inspect Console ul style display none"
  alt="Test Inspect Console ul style display none." />

<p>You'll see when I do this over here, if I test the page, they all go
away, and if I inspect this, you'll see they have displayed style,
display none over here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 116. example, hide() helper function (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image116.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Hide() Helper Function"
  alt="Example, Hide() Helper Function." />

<p>Now, as it turns out, there's actually an easier way of doing that,
because <b>jQuery</b> has a bunch of helper functions built in. One of
them is hide. Since frequently we want to hide things on our page, they
created a helper function called hide, which hides those elements.
That's even easier than using the CSS method here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 117. $('ul li ul').hide(); (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image117.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="$('ul li ul').hide();"
  alt="$('ul li ul').hide();" />
  
<p>If I just put hide there, and then come back and test it, you'll see
the menus are hidden. Not only that, but if I inspect and look in there,
you'll see it's still says, display none there. This is actually doing
the exact same thing but using the CSS method, but instead we're using
the hide method. That's a convenience function that <b>jQuery</b> has
built-in. <b>jQuery</b> is a bunch of these built-in for doing common
tasks. We'll see another one of these convenient helper functions in
just a minute. We've got that going, and we're ready to start building
in our Click-Handler and doing all that fun stuff. We'll do that in the
next lesson.</p>

  alt="Example, Get the Next UL." />

<p>Once again, we're going to use the <b>this</b> keyword in order to get
the menu that was clicked. However, this time we're going to wrap it up
inside of a <b>jQuery</b> object. So down here, you can see we've got
this, but it's inside a <b>jQuery</b> object. Then we're going to use
the handy next method that <b>jQuery</b> has built in. And in the plain
Javascript version, remember what we had to do was we had to go get that
parent object and then find the <b>ul</b> inside the parent. But here we
can actually use the <b>next</b> method to get the next ul.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 120. html a tag menu links (72) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image120.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="HTML 'a' tag menu links"
  alt="HTML 'a' tag menu links." />

<p>Because remember, what users are doing is they're clicking on this link
here, this anchor tag. And I want to get the next <b>ul</b> that comes
after that. And <b>jQuery</b> has this helper function that's very
useful for that.</p>

  title="New var thisMenu for next Unordered List item"
  alt="New var thisMenu for next Unordered List item." />

<p>Let's come down here and add that into here. We're going to make a
variable, <b>var thisMenu</b> is assigned. We're going to use the
<b>jQuery</b> object to get this. And then we're going to use the
.<b>next</b> method to go get the next <b>ul</b>. And that will get the
<b>ul</b> that comes up after this particular anchor tag that we've
clicked on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 122. console.log thismenu (73) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image122.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="console.log thisMenu .html"
  alt="console.log thisMenu .html." />

<p>And just to see that this works, I'm going to say, <b>console.log(
thisMenu. .html())</b>. This html(), this is a <b>jQuery</b> method that
will generate the <b>html</b>. So let's see what we get if we test this.
If I come over to my page and refresh and then turn on my inspector to
get the Console log here and click on this menu, you can see that I'm
getting that <b>html</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image123.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Showing the Hidden Menu"
  alt="Example, Showing the Hidden Menu." />

<p>The next thing we need to do is check to see if the menu is showing or
hidden or not. And we can do that with this sort of function here. We
could say if this menu is visible, and there's a method called is in
<b>jQuery</b> that will allow us to check for something. Here, visible
is a filter that will allow us to see if a particular element is
visible, in which case then we can hide it or we could show it. Now, we
could do this and this works if you wanted to do it this way. And the is
method is sometimes very helpful in <b>jQuery</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 124. example, do this instead (75) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Do This Instead"
  alt="Example, Do This Instead." />

<p>However, in this case there is another helper function, a convenient
helper function that will do the same thing in a nice, simple way. And
that is toggle, <b>thisMenu.toggle</b>. That's all we need to do, so
that if it's showing hide it, if it's hiding show it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 125. hide all menu options, on click, toggle (75) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image125.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Hide all menu options, on click, toggle"
  alt="Hide all menu options, on click, toggle." />

<p>Let's add that into our script over here. I can just say
<b>thisMenu.toggle</b>. Very helpful, convenient function in
<b>jQuery</b> that you could use in many situations.</p>

<p>Now you'll notice that we're back to where we were after numerous
lines of code before in plain Javascript where we can open the menus and
we can close the menus. Unfortunately, we can still open all the menus
and close all the menus, which is not exactly what we want. But we're
close with just a couple lines of <b>jQuery</b>. And part of the reason
why it's so short is that we don't need loops because <b>jQuery</b>
works with groups of <b>objects</b> like this. And it's got these helper
functions built in, so we don't have to write the if statement and do
all of that.</p>

<p>The last part of the script we need to figure out is how to make it
so that when I click on one menu, it closes all of the menus and then
only opens the one that I clicked on. And we'll do that in the next
lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch1-18">1.18 The Whole Script (5:59)</h2>

  title="1.18 The Whole Script"

<p>To get this final piece of functionality that we want, we need one more
line in our script.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 127. example, the whole script (77) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image127.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, The Whole Script"
  alt="Example, The Whole Script." />

<p>And it's just a short simple little line that we need to add and it will
introduce us to yet another convenient function built into <b>jQuery</b>
which is the <b>not</b> method here. And what that does is it excludes a
particular item from a function, we can chain these functions together.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 128. select all ul's, hide, toggle clicked menus (77) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>So here we're going to say go get all of the unordered lists that are
inside the list item, that are inside the not word lists, those are sub
menus. But not the one that we clicked on. And we're going to hide all
of the other ones, but not the one that we clicked on, because that may
be hidden already or we may want to show it, and then we can do the menu
toggle and it will work. Just one last little line, let's go ahead and
put this in over here.</p>

<p>Once again I'm going to use my <b>jQuery</b> object to go in and get
the <b>ul li ul</b>. The unordered list that are inside the list items
are inside the an ordered list is our sub menus. But not this menu, the
one that I clicked on. That one I don't want to be affected by this line
at all. And then I'm going to do hide, make sure all of those are

<p>Let's come back and test it. I can open a menu, I can open the next
menu, I can close the menu. And I'm getting exactly the functionality
that I had before.</p>

  alt="Move all to external script &amp; use strict." />

<p>Okay, the last step that we need to do is just make our script file and
move this stuff over into an external script file. So let's do that
here. Up here I'm going to add <b>script.js</b>. And then I'm going to
come back here. Then I'm going to add my IIFE function parentheses,
curly braces, and then one more set of parentheses in a semi colon. And
then I'm going to come in here and add my <b>use strict</b> directive.
And then I'm going to grab this entire script. Cut that and stick it in
here. Close that up. I've got a little short script here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>This can become constant. That's the only thing we need to take care of
here, it's the only variable. And then over here we can get rid of this
script tag entirely. And we can move the link to <b>jQuery</b> up to the
top of the page inside the head here.</p>

<p>Don't forget to add the <b>defer</b> attribute there. And then down here
I'm going to add a script tag with src set to quote, <b>script.js
defer</b>. And that will work, this file has to come after that file,
even if we're putting him on the head of the page using the defer
attribute. Because once again, we need to make sure that we're using
these functions from this library here in the script so it has to load first.</p>

<p>And it's working just fine. I can get to my menu items. It's not a fancy
page, but this is a good example that shows you how to take a script and
do the same thing that we did in plain JavaScript, but using
<b>jQuery</b>. And using some of the nifty <b>jQuery</b> helper
functions such as <b>hide</b>, the <b>click handler</b>, the <b>next</b>
method, the <b>not</b> method, the <b>toggle</b> method, all make it
possible for us to write shorter scripts, along with the fact that you
don't have to do loops. So that makes it much shorter and hopefully
you're pretty excited about this.</p>

<p>One of the best ways of learning JavaScript is through these challenges,
and in particular now that we're getting into <b>jQuery</b> it's
important to get used to the <b>jQuery</b> syntax.</p>

  alt="How to Do These Challenges." />
  
<p>The way these challenges work is we'll pose a challenge, I'll put
forward a challenge, and I'll have you do it in both JavaScript and
<b>jQuery</b>. This will really help you with the syntax of both
JavaScript and <b>jQuery</b>, and understanding the differences between
the two.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Challenge 1 - JavaScript"
  alt="Example, Challenge 1 - JavaScript." />

<p>I'll provide you with a challenge like this, and usually the challenges
start off fairly simple and then they become more complex as we move
through the challenges. I'll give you a challenge like this and then on
the next slide, if you need to look the solution is on the next slide,
but hopefully you don't really need to look at the solution. Really try
to do the challenges without looking at the solution. If you have to
look at the solution that's fine, you can look at the solution and
hopefully you'll go ah-ha, I see what I was supposed to do and then you
can go back and do the challenge without looking at the solution.</p>

<p>If you want to learn Javascript or <b>jQuery</b> you have to get used to
the syntax and this is the best way to get there, is to really force
yourself to do these challenges, and do them several times, do them over
and over again. Do them today and then do them again tomorrow, and
tomorrow when you do them hopefully you'll be able to do more of the
challenges without looking at the answers. Each challenge builds on the
next so that they become more complex as they go along, and that will
really help you learn both JavaScript and <b>jQuery</b>, and help you
understand the differences between the syntax of how each of them work.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you've made it to the 2nd module in our 2<sup>nd</sup>
course on JavaScript. In this module, we'll be working with the
<b>jQuery</b> effects library, which provides you with a lot of
animation effects that you can use with all sorts of projects and in
your interfaces. We'll compare that to using JavaScript and <b>CSS</b>
to create your animations and see how the two are different and what are
the strengths and pros and cons of each as you learn and work on
projects. It's a lot of fun and you're really going to enjoy it. Buckle
in and let's get started with learning about the effects library in
<b>jQuery</b>.

  title="Important Considerations - CSS vs JavaScript Animations"
  alt="Important Considerations - CSS vs JavaScript Animations." />

<p>We'll be looking at how to use the effects library that's built into
<b>jQuery</b>. But there's some important things to understand about
animation in JavaScript versus animation in <b>CSS</b>. Generally, it's
better to do animation in <b>CSS</b> if at all possible. When the
animation is done in <b>CSS</b>, the computer's <b>GPU</b> can be used
to help with the processing of the animation, that will make the
animation smoother and more efficient. You'll particularly notice this
on phones, especially older phones.</p>

<p>However, the effects library in <b>jQuery</b> is really easy to use, and
for something minor or if you need something really quick, it can be a
great option. In this particular lesson, we'll be looking at how to use
the effects library in <b>jQuery</b>. I have some example files that you
can download and when you open them up, they look nice.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>Here's example 1. We'll look at how to apply some effects using these
buttons here.</p>

  alt="New code in index.html." />
  
<p>If we go over and look at the HTML involved here, I just have some links
with these buttons, and then I've got this box here.</p>

<p>I've got a little bit of CSS as appear to make it look nice and that's
fine. Down here, you'll notice that I have <b>jQuery</b> plugged in so
that's all set and ready to go, and a place for us to put our script.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 142. first button, hide function (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image142.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="First button, hide function"
  alt="First button, hide function." />
  
<p>Now, the first one that we're going to look at is the <b>hide</b>
function (furthest left of the 3 buttons) which we've already looked at
before. We've seen this <b>hide</b> function when we did the sidebar
menu exercise. But the hide function can also do animation. Let's take a
look at how to do that.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 143. define box hidden (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image143.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Define box hidden"
  alt="Define box hidden." />
<p>
Over here, what I could do is I could type in here, I could go get this
first link here. I'm going to go get and use my <b>jQuery</b> object.
Then I'm going to get <b>hide</b> box, that link. I'm going to add a
quick add onto it, click. When I click it, I'm going to run a function,
like so. In that function, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get this
element again using my <b>jQuery</b> object. This element box, div id
pound box. I tell it to, hide. Now if we do it like this, it will work,
but it won't do any animation.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 144. test, hide box fades away (87) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image144.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test, hide box fades away"
  alt="Test, hide box fades away." />

<p>Let's try it out. If I come over here and refresh this page and click
"Hide," you can see the box goes away.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 145/146. jquery hide box & test (87) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Test, jQuery box hide normal"
  alt="Test, jQuery box hide normal." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>But in <b>jQuery</b>, you can actually pass a value in here. There are a
few keywords that it can use. You can use normal, slow, or fast. You'll
see now when I do refresh and click "Hide," it does an animation as it
hides that box.
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 147/148. hide box fade in 500 milliseconds (88) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Test, hide box fade in 500 milliseconds"
  alt="Test, hide box fade in 500 milliseconds." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>You could do slow or fast, or you could put in a number. The number is
the number of milliseconds. If I put 500, that will be half a second,
it's how long the animation will take place. Or if you really want to
see something to demonstrate how much that affects it, you could do
2,002 seconds. That's a long time for an animation like this.</p>

  title="Test showbox click, fade 500 milliseconds"
  alt="Test showbox click, fade 500 milliseconds." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's add a couple more. We've got a few more buttons here. Let's do a
few more of these. I'm going to do pound show box or hashtag if you
prefer hash instead. I'm going to add the <b>click handler</b> and then
put a function in here. Always type from the outside, so you get used to
the syntax and understand which thing closes which thing. I'm going to
do function parentheses, curly braces there and move that down. Then I'm
going to do again, I'm going to go get my <b>jQuery</b> object and get
pound <b>showbox</b>. No box, just box of the same box. Instead of hide
I'm going to do <b>show</b>. Maybe we'll make this one go for 500
milliseconds. You'll see that will work.</p>

<p>Let's test that. We come over here and refresh this. We can hide the box
and I can show the box and you can see the difference in time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 153. define toggle function (90) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image153.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Define toggle box function"
  alt="Define toggle box function." />

<p>Now toggle will both hide and show. If it's hidden, it'll show it. If
it's showing it'll hide it. Over here again, I'm going to just add
toggle box. It's this link here. It's this link up here, toggle box.
Then down here we're going to do box and instead of show, we're going to
do <b>toggle</b> like that. Remember toggle is a helper function that
allows us to do both hiding and showing and we've seen that before. But
now we can use it with the effects library and do some animation with
it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 154. toggle function, 500 mill, alert (91) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image154.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Define toggle function, 500 milliseconds fade, test alert"
  alt="Define toggle function, 500 milliseconds fade, test alert." />

<p>Now one of the really great things about these animations and doing this
in JavaScript and <b>jQuery</b> is that you have a thing called a
<b>callback</b> function. What you can do after the toggle(500) is you
can pass in a function that runs with its parentheses and curly braces
like so. In here we could put alert ('done! ') something like that. This
function will run after this animation has been completed. In fact, I'm
going to make this a little bit longer so that you can really see that
it waits and runs after the animation has been completed.</p>

<p>This is useful because sometimes you want to have a sequence of
animations and when that animation is done, you want to do something
else, something like that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 155. alert test, toggle function (92) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image155.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test Alert, toggle function"
  alt="Test Alert, toggle function." />

<p>Let's see how this works. The page does the alert. That's really cool
and I could do the other way around as well. With that, we are able to
see that we can make these functions, these animations and the
animations can have a <b>callback</b> function that runs when the
animation is complete and this is useful. Let's take a look at the next
example in the next lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch2-03">2.03 Example 2 (5:35)</h2>

<p>Open up the Example 2, HTML file and you'll notice that it looks very
similar to the first example. We have the same styling up at the top of
the page, we have a box here, we have some navigation, and then we have
this div id set to box down here, and it's just an empty div.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="jQuery Helper Functions"
  alt="jQuery Helper Functions." />
  
<p>You can see that it looks very similar here. But <b>jQuery</b> has
helper functions in for <b>sliding up</b> and <b>sliding down</b> and
<b>slide toggle</b>. Because again, these are common tasks. These are
common things that we need to do in interfaces, so they created a method
that does specifically this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 159. #slideupbox.click function (94) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image159.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="#slideupbox.click function #box.slideUp('slow')"
  alt="#slideupbox.click function #box.slideUp('slow')." />
  
<p>Let's take a look at what we need in order to do this in our code. The
syntax is very similar to what we saw before. What we're going to do is,
like we did before, we're going to use our <b>jQuery</b> object to go in
and get our link here.</p>

<p>It's pound, I've got a <b>slideupbox</b> as a link here, so let's do
that. <b>slideupbox</b> and we'll put a <b>click handler</b> on that.
We're looking for <b>dot click</b>. Then in here we're going to run a
function with its own parentheses and curly braces. Then we're going to
put our code inside the curly braces there, just the same way we did
before. Again as before, we're going to go get our <b>jQuery</b> object
and get box, because that's where we're going to be moving up and down.
Then what we're going to use here for a <b>jQuery</b> function is slide
up. Again, we can put in an amount of time or you could put inside
quotes, you can put slow or something like that, and that will make that
box slide up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 160. test, slideup (95) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image160.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test, slideup"
  alt="Test, slideup." />
  
<p>Let's go over and give that a try. Hopefully I did that right, I think I
did. If I refresh this page and click "Slideup," it does that animation.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 161. inspect console, slideup (95) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>It's interesting to inspect this. Watch what happens here. Actually on the 
actual box itself. Watch what happens down here, when I click slideup. You can 
see it very quickly went through some settings in here, as it did that and ended 
up with displaying that.</p>

<p>The other ones look very similar as you can imagine. We've got
<b>slideupbox</b>, we've got <b>slidedownbox</b>, and we've got <b>slide
toggle</b> and they all work very similarly. I can actually copy that,
paste it, and I recommend you type it actually, but for expedience sake,
I'm going to just copy and paste it and change this to slidedownbox.
This is going to be <b>SlideDown</b> and I can choose an amount of time.
We're going to do two seconds, something like that. We have a longer
time.</p>

<p>Now, when you're working with animation, one thing to be aware of is
that, there is such a thing as <b>easing</b>. An animation can run and
it will run for the period of time. This animation will run over two
seconds, but it can run the exact same amount over those two seconds,
which is <b>linear easing</b>, meaning that it's the same speed at the
beginning as it is at the end or you can change the <b>easing</b> such
that it goes faster at the beginning and slower at the end or slower at
the beginning and then speeds up towards the end of the animation, or
you can actually do <b>easing</b> in and outward. Starts slow, speeds up
and then end slow or starts fast, slows down and ends fast. You can do
all of these different types of easing.</p>

<p><b>jQuery</b> has some basic <b>easing</b> built-in and you can put in
here in quotes, <b>"swing"</b>. That will do a little bit of
<b>easing</b> on this item. It's pretty subtle. You might not really see
it, but it will actually work. Take a look for yourself. Slide up, slide
down. Does slide down, but it does a swing animation. It's not the same
speed all the way through. It's hard to tell, but it is there, just
subtle.</p>

<p><b>jQuery</b> has built into it some basic <b>easing.</b> There's also a

<p><b>Easing</b> can give your animations a little bit of personality. They
can make them seem a little bit less mechanical, when the speed of the
animation is not always the same all the way through the animation. But
the <b>easings</b> that are built into <b>jQuery</b> don't give you a
lot of options. They are very basic.</p>

<p>There's this amazing <b>plug-in (gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/)</b>
that we can use, and it allows you to choose different types of
<b>easings</b> so that you can do some different types of things with
this, and you can go through and try some of these different settings
here to see what they actually do. <b>Ease-out</b> will affect the
animation at the end where <b>ease-in</b> will affect the animation at
the beginning, <b>ease-out-and-in</b> will affect the animation at both
ends. We've got <b>ease-in-and-out</b>. We've got a whole bunch of them
in here for all these different: in <b>ease-out</b>, <b>ease-in</b> all
these different animations in here. But in order to use this, we have to
plugins <b>plug-in</b>.</p>

    50 Awesome jQuery Plugins</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>jQuery</b> has a plug-in architecture that allows you to add more
functionality to <b>jQuery</b>. You can see over here on our file that
I've already added the plug-in. The way this works is first we need the
<b>jQuery</b> library, then you need the plug-in, and then we use it in
our script.</p>

<p>Down here I'm going to do the third animation here for slide toggle,
which we're going to use this ID. We'll grab that ID, and down here
instead of slide down, we're going to do slide toggle, which will open
it and close it. Here we can use some of the other easings that we find
on this website here;</p>

</ul>

<p>This is where I got the <b>easing</b> plug-in on the <b>CDN</b> that I put 
into here. That's where that came from, <b>Cloudflare</b>.</p>

<p>That comes from this website here; But we can use the easings that we see 
here. If I want an <b>easeOutBounce</b>, I can actually use that animation if 
I want to over here. Let's give that a try.</p>

<p><b>"easeOutBounce"</b>. Make sure you spell it right with the capital letters 
and everything <b>easeOutBounce</b>. Make sure you spell it all correct and that 
you get the correct capital letters. Make sure you put it inside the quotes, and 
so on and so forth.</p>

<p>If I save that and then come back and look at my example here, and click
slide toggle, you can see that it does this bounce. Which is pretty
interesting or you could do <b>easeInBounce</b> to get the bounce on the
opposite end of the animation, which might look a little weird. It's
doing the bounce first and then it's finishing the animation, which
looks a little weird, but you get the idea and you can try some of these
other easings and see what personality you can get.</p>

<p>I really like the <b>easeOutCirc</b> ones. Yeah, <b>easeIn</b> and
<b>easeOutCirc</b>. You can give those a try. Let's see what we can do
with that. Over here <b>easeInCirc</b>. Again, at two seconds, that's
pretty slow. You can even slow down more if you wanted to see it. I'll
set that to three seconds. You can see how it changes the animation by
either slowing it down or speeding it up. I think this one's speeding it
up as it gets to the end of the animation.</p>

does its thing.</p>

<p>You could try <b>easeInOutCirc</b>. It's hard to see, but it is doing 
something there. Try these different animations. You'll notice if you spell 
them wrong, if I do, <b>easeoutCirc</b> like that, then it won't work quite 
right at all.</p>

<p>One last quick thing here before we're done with this lesson is you can also 
add the <b>callback</b> function after the <b>easing</b>. I could add a function 
here and say done, and you'll see that when that <b>easing</b> is finished, when 
that animation is finished, that <b>callback</b> function will fire.</p>

<p>It's got four buttons and we can use some built-in functions in

to a particular percentage of opacity.</p>

  alt="Sample screen, fadeOut." />

<p>Here I have <b>fade out</b>, which will fade it out completely. <b>Fadein</b>, 
will fade it all the way to being visible. But then I had <b>fade</b> to 20 percent, 
which will fade it to 20 percent opacity, and then <b>fade</b> to 100 percent, 
which will <b>fade</b> it all the way in.</p>

  style="width:50%"
  title="fadeoutbox.click function fadeOut, 3 milliseconds"
  alt="fadeoutbox.click function fadeOut, 3 milliseconds." />

<p>Let's take a look at how we can do that. Over here I have Example 3 open
and you can see that I have much the same styling up at the top of the
page, as well as my navigation year and my <b>jQuery</b> libraries
plugged in. I don't have the easing plug-in here, but you could add it
if you wanted to add some easing to these as well.</p>

<p>Here we're going to do what we did before with getting our link pound
fade out box, which is this first link up here, and we're going to add
our click handler to it. Click, and then we're going to pass in our
anonymous function that runs when you click that thing. In here, we're
going to go get our box.</p>

<p>Again, we use our <b>jQuery</b> object to get pound box. Then we're
going to do, I believe the function is <b>fadeout</b> because we're
fading out the first one. Yeah, fadeout. Again, we could put in normal
or you could put fast, or you could put slow, or you could put a
specific number of milliseconds; 3,003 seconds is a long time, but we
can actually give that a try. You'll see that will actually work over
here. Over three seconds, it will become invisible.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~ 176. fadeoutbox click function fadeout 3000, swing alert done (105) ~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:50%"
  title="fadeoutbox click function fadeOut 3000, swing alert done"
  alt="fadeoutbox click function fadeOut 3000, swing alert done." />

<p>We could do <b>fadein</b> as well. I can copy that and paste it or just
type it again. It's always a good idea to do that, but we're going to
use this <b>ID</b> instead. Instead of fade out, we're going to fade in.
I could do three seconds and you could do the easing swing. It's going
to go in quotes, ''swing.''</p>

<p>Then you could also add a callback function, and that's parentheses.
Inside the curly braces, we can add an ''alert'' that says "done." When
the animation is complete, it runs the alert and says that it's done.
That's great. We can do all of that. Okay, cool. Now we just need to add
these last two here and we can look at that in the next lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch2-06">2.06 Example 3: Fade To (4:07)</h2>

<p>And with that, there's a fade to method that we can use in <b>jQuery</b>.</p>

<p>So here, just as we've done before, we can add a new event handler for when you 
click the the button has fadeto20box on here. I'm going to paste that in just to 
make sure I spell it right and we'll add a click handler And then in here, we'll 
add a function that runs when you click it, it's just an anonymous function. And 
what we're going to do here is once again, we'll go get pound box. Don't forget 
the pound sign.</p>

<p>And we're going to use the fade to method. See it even comes up here, fade to. 
And we're going to fade to, the way this works is we're going to put in the amount 
of time. So we'll do, again I'll do 3000, just to kind of slow but gives us a 
sense of what that is. But then the second number it takes is a <b>duration</b>, 
an amount. Takes the <b>duration</b>, that's the first number. The second number 
is how much it's going to <b>fade</b> <b>to</b>. We want to do 0.2 like that. 
And now, that should actually work.</p>

<p>We can do that and then we can do the fade to again for the last one.
We're going to use this link <b>fadeTo</b>. When you click the fadeTo,
it's going to fade to one. The opacity is a number between 0 and 1, 0 is
completely transparent, 1 is completely opaque.</p>

<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> button has the callback function and the swing
animation on it. And if you wanted to do some of the other easings, you
would have to go get that <b>easing plug</b> in and stick it after
<b>jQuery</b> loads.</p>

<p>But before we run our script, the order in which things loads matters
because of the way that the functions build on each other. We need to
have <b>jQuery</b>. In order to use <b>jQuery</b>, we would need to have
the <b>easing</b> <b>plug-in</b> in in order to use the using plug in.
Using <b>plug in</b> has to come after <b>jQuery</b>. All of this stuff
has to go in order on your page for it to work properly. We can have the
<b>callback</b> functions. And then in the next example, an example for,
we'll look at some custom animations where you can do some different
kinds of things. In examples 1, 2 and 3, we've used some of the built-in
convenience functions that <b>jQuery</b> has built into it.</p>

<p>For fading in and out, for sliding up and down, for hiding and showing,
and toggling, slide toggle and doing all these kinds of things that we
commonly need to do. But sometimes you need to do a custom function, and
we'll take a look at that in the next part of this lesson.</p>

just a little bit.</p>

<p>There are more links here and my box now has some content inside the div
box here, and you'll see that my stylings is a little bit different up
here, if you look at the actual page, it looks like this now. We're

<p>To do this, we'll use the animate method in <b>jQuery</b>, and you'll
see that it allows us to animate some, not all, but some of the CSS
properties that we have come to know and love over the years in working
with CSS. That gives us a lot of power, because we can actually use
these CSS properties to animate all different things not just sliding up
and down or showing and hiding and doing this kind of stuff.</p>

I'm going to add a click event handler on there, and then I'm going to
pass in a function that runs when you click it, and everything's going
to go inside these curly brackets here. At this point I want to affect
box, pound box, don't forget the pound sign. We're going to do the

We have not yet worked with objects in JavaScript, they're coming, we're
going to get to them later in our instruction about JavaScript, but will
see them pop up a few times and this is one of those times. I'll explain
it a little bit now, but we'll get into objects in more detail a bit
later, and an object is an alternative way of storing data in
JavaScript, and it comes with a key value pair.</p>

<p>
We define an object with the curly braces, and then we have a key value
pair. In this case, the key is width, that's the <b>CSS</b> property
we're animating, and then the value is 710px, and you'll notice that the
value goes inside quotes, but the key does not. That's a distinguishing
aspect of objects in JavaScript in general and also in <b>jQuery</b>.

in "710px". That will move the box. It'll change the width of the box to
710 pixels. If I come over here and test this, refresh grow box, and you
can see it sets it so that it 710 pixels. I knew it was 710 pixels to
end right here. Let's take a look at growing the text and affecting the

just to make sure you're getting exactly the right thing, and then we'll do click 
parentheses and a semicolon. That click handler will run when we click on grow 
text. Then we're going to come in your add a function that runs when we click on 
that, on secret square braces. I want curly braces.</p>

<p>Move that down and then once again, I'm going to go get my box, pound box inside 
quotes there. I'm going to run the animate. The custom animate function here and 
again, we're going to pass in with curly braces, not square brackets, curly braces 
and object. What are we going to do here? We're going to do font in quotes. No, 
this one looks like this.</p>

<p>We come over here. Font size. We're using the JavaScript version of font
size rather than the CSS version, which is font dash size. We can't have
the dash in there because JavaScript will think that looks like a minus
sign, and so it's trying to subtract size from font and it's not going
to work. Instead what we want is <b>fontSize</b>, colon and then I can
set it to say 24 px or something like that and that should change the
font size.</p>

<p>Grow the box grow the text. That's working just fine and you can try a
different size text if you wanted to do 36 pixels or 40 or whatever you
want to do that'll be a little bit more dramatic. Grow the box, grow the
text and that's working great.</p>

<p>We could also move the box. Let's give that one a try. With move box, what 
we're going to do, we're actually going to change the position of the box, and 
in order to do that, we need to set some positioning for box.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>In our CSS over here for box, we need to add position absolute, and then
we want to set the left position, left 50 px. Why is it 50 pixels?
Because everything else is, is indented 50 pixels in here. I think I
have that, yes, he said padding 50 pixels. If I don't set left 50
pixels, let's take a look at this really quickly. If I reset that, that
puts that in the right place. But if I didn't put the 50 pixels in
there, left 50 pixels, maybe it won't actually do anything, okay, well
actually maybe be fine.</p>

<p>But still I want to set the left 50 pixels so that I'm moving from this
position, left 50 pixels. Because we're going to change the left
property when we move the box. Down here again, I'm just going to copy
this for the sake of making it a little bit quicker and down here
instead of grow text, I'm going to move box. Move box, animate and then
here I'm going to change the left property, left, and I'm going to do
plus equals 300 px, so that we'll add 300 pixels to the 50 pixels that's
already there. Plus equals, we'll add 300 pixels to the 50 pixels.</p>

<p>
You can set how long you want that animation take. You can make it go
longer if you wanted to and after the animate, after the object here, I
could add in a comma and say, I want this to run over five seconds,
something like that, and that will animate over five seconds. Let's see
what that does. Five seconds is really slow, but it is animating . We're
able to adjust the amount of time and the amount that it moves in, what
it does with the actual animation, all with custom animation.

<p>They're all going to move forward at the same time. We will change both
the width, the font, and the left positioning of three of these. We're
going to change all of them at once. We can do that by just passing in
these different properties into our object all at once, separating them
with commas.</p>

  title="doall script"
  alt="doall script." />
  
<p>Let's do that. Down here, once again, I'm going to use my <b>jQuery</b>
object to go get this pound, but what I want is do all. I'm going to get
pound do all. Then I'm going to add a click handler. Click for when you
click the <b>doall</b> button, and then we're going to run a function,
when that button is clicked, and here we have it. Here now, we want to
effect a parentheses pound box, like so. Again, we're going to do the
animate method. We're going to pass in our object, so we do the curly
braces. First we want width, 710 pixels, so I put that in here. Width,
710 pixels and then a comma. Then we want font size, 36 pixels, I put
that in there. Then a comma. Then we want left plus equals 300. We'll
put that in there.</p>
<p>You'll see now there's some extra spaces at the end. It doesn't really
matter, it's fine, but you'll see with all of those in there, that now
when I come over and test this thing, I also want to put in an amount of
time, that will be really helpful. After the curly brace, put a comma,
and then I'm going to put 1500. It's going to take a second-and-a-half
to do all of these.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 201. test doall, example4.html (119) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Test doall, example4.html"

<p>Let's come back over here and refresh this. When I click Do All, it
should do all of those things.</p>

  alt="sequence script." />

<p>Now, the last button is to do them in a sequence. First we want to grow
the box, then we want to grow the text, then we want to move the box. We
want to do each one of these in a sequence. We can do that with
<b>callback</b> functions.</p>

<p>Each one of these animations can have its own callback functions that
when it finishes it calls the next one and when that one finishes it
calls the next one. It can be confusing for the syntax in order to get
this to work, but once you understand it and know how to do it and mess
with it a little bit, it's not too hard.</p>

<p>Let's do this again. I'm going to start with this one. I'm going to copy
that and stick it down here. Instead of getting that button, I'm going
to get this one sequence. When you click the button Sequence, it's going
to take box and it's going to animate the width to 710 px. I'm going to
put a comma. Another comma, yeah, I'm going to put a comma, and then I'm
going to put say 1500 for how long that animation should take place. I'm
going to put another comma, and I'm going to add a function. It's really
easy to get confused here because we're going to put everything into
this function here. I'm going to make sure I click between those curly
braces, move that down.</p>

<p>Then I'm gonna go get this one, font-size 36. I'm going to put a comma
here and I'm going to put 1500 seconds in there. The 1500 milliseconds,
that's 1.5 seconds. 1500 milliseconds in there, and then a comma and
another function, parentheses, curly braces. It's really easy to lose
track of this stuff. You have to be really careful with it, but then I'm
going to put the next one inside these curly braces. I move that down,
and I'm going to do this one here. Now change that to 1500. There we go.
That's the last one. It doesn't get a <b>callback</b> function.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 203. test, sequence (120) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image203.png"

  title="Test, sequence"
  alt="Test, sequence." />

<p>Let's see if that works. If I come over here and test this, refresh, if
I did it right, sequence, it should do that one and that finishes. It
does that, and then it moves it, and everything is working all in a
sequence.</p>

<p>With the JavaScript effects library, we can do all kinds of really
interesting things. You can animate all kinds of different CSS
properties. However, it is better to do the animations in CSS with
transitions or keyframe animations in CSS, and then apply those classes,
but sometimes using the effects library in JavaScript is still useful.
Especially if you're doing something fairly quick, there's not a lot of
reason not to use it. We'll see an example of when is a good place to
use this effects library coming up when we create a tabbed interface.</p>

<p>This is a good project for seeing how that effects library can be effective

too intensive with it, but it's a nice use of effects library.</p>

see the difference between the two, and compare the code between the two
versions.</p>

<p>Let's get started and see what this is going to look like.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Second half; div, ul, li and tabs in HTML." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>If we go and look at the markup file over here, you'll see that the way it's 
setup is we have a div called tabs with an idea of tabs, and in here we have an 
unordered list. These things are going to be the actual tabs that you click on.</p>

<p>Then the href for these links to the id's for these pieces of content down 
here, and this is the content that will be on each tab. This is typical for the 
setup for this type of interface, is that you would have an unordered list that 
makes the tabs, and the tabs themselves would have id's that match the href's 
for them up here. That's the basic markup that we're going to be using, and it 
should really work well for us.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image210.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, CSS"
  alt="Example, CSS." />

<p>From there we need to add some basic styling because currently in the
page, if you open up the start files in the browser, they look like
this, so there's very little styling here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="CSS rules for body, tabs, tabs &gt; ul." />

<p>I've done just a little bit on my style sheet, so you can come over here
and see styles.css. I've got this reset rule, which is not great to use
for production websites. But for this, it's just taking margin and
padding off of everything.</p>

<p>Then we're just adding some padding to the body and setting the
background color and the font and the color. Let's add a few rules here
to make sure that we get this thing all in place. The first rule I'm
going to add is for the tabs themselves, so this is the entire interface
really. I'm just going to give it a width of 400 pixels and set margin
to auto so that it centers on the screen.</p>

<p>With those two pieces in place. Then for the actual tabs, for the
unordered list, I'm going to get rid of the bullets and set them to
display <b>flex</b>, so they go next to each other.</p>

<p>You might wonder about the single bracket, and what this does is it
makes sure that the unordered list, that's inside the tabs directly, the
direct descended is targeted.</p>

<p>Example 1, something like this, li. Example 2, something like that. But
I didn't want this unordered list to get targeted by my rules, I only
want this one because this is actual content in my tab. That's why I'm
using the angle bracket here, is that it will only target the specific
selector for my element tabs that are there. We've got that in place,
and now my tabs are lining up next to each other, still doesn't look
very good, but we're getting there.We'll continue with the styling in
the next lesson.</p>

<p>The next rule styles the actual anchor tags that are inside the list

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Styling the Anchor Tags"
  alt="Example, Styling the Anchor Tags." />

<p>And again I've got the angle brackets to very specifically get the
elements I specifically want. And this is a longer rule so I'm going to
paste it in but you're going to have to type it so, I'm going to come
over here and I'll add it here and again you're going to have to type
it.</p>

<p>But first thing I want the anchor tags to display block elements not in
line elements. Remember anchor tags by default in line elements and I
want them to displace block and what that does is it makes the entire
area of the tab clickable not just the text. Plus it makes padding and
margin a little bit easier to work with unblock elements because they
don't all affect in line elements quite the same way.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 215. styling settings tabs (127) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image215.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Set style settings on id Tabs"
  alt="Set style settings on id Tabs." />

<p>I'm setting the height 30 pixels and the line nine to 30 pixels and that
puts the text in the vertical center. As long as it doesn't wrap around
margin on the right to pixels to create a little bit of a gap and then
I'm just setting a background color, the color of the actual font color
and then the text decoration. I'm getting rid of the underlining putting
some padding on the left and right.</p>

<p>So zero 15 pixels that would be zero on the top and bottom and 15 pixels
and left and right. And then I'm doing some border radius where I'm
putting the border giving a little three pixel radius on the top left
and top right of each tab.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 216. test, tabs display (128) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Test, tabs display." />

<p>With that in place you'll see over here if you save that, you'll see
that the tabs are starting to display the way we want them to display
and they're looking like tabs. We have a few more rules that we need to
adhere to make our make our interface look that we wanted to look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 217. tabs > div, tabs > div:first-of-type (128) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:50%" 
  title="Target divs with id='tabs'"
  alt="Target divs with id='tabs'." />

<p>But this is again going to target the divs that are specifically these
divs that are labeled <b>tabs-1</b> because again I could add a div in
here as part of my content and I don't want that to be affected.</p>

<p>But I want just these divs here the ones that are tab one tattoo and tab
three to be affected by this rule. And basically what I'm doing here is
I'm setting them so they don't display initially at all. So that hides
them all entirely and then I'm just giving them a little bit of padding
and setting the background color. But then the first one I want the
first one to display is block and set its background color.</p>

these tabs are showing and really I just want the first one to show. So
when I refresh this you'll see that the first tab is showing but the
other tabs are not and I'm not going to have styling for these list
items in here.</p>

<p>So I'm going to go in and take them out just because I don't need that
stuff in there. That was just to demonstrate that those won't get
targeted by the other rule. I take that stuff out for now, that's great.</p>

  alt="Style p, line-height: 1.5em, margin-bottom: 1em." />

<p>And then I've got a couple other really minor rules for styling that
will fix up the way we want our taps to look and everything to look for
this project, switch back to the styles and add two more rules you have
to add in here.</p>

<p>The 1st one (<b>first-of-type</b>) is styling the <b>anchor</b> tags
again, this is getting our first tab up at the top of the page and I'm
just changing its color and changing it's background so it matches our
interface. And then I'm giving some styling to the paragraphs to make
them look a bit better.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 222. first tab only highlighted (131) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image222.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Only the first tab is highlighted"
  alt="Only the first tab is highlighted." />

<p>Now we have the actual interface. It doesn't function but this is the
interface that we want for our tabs. And the reason why I showed you the
styling is again because javascript is very much tied to the browser and
tied to adjusting the styling.</p>

<p>It's important to understand how the styling works and that when you're
making an interface like this, you want to get the styling for the
widget or the element or the interface element to work properly before
you start working on the javascript.</p>

<p>So here we have three tabs but two of them are set to display none and
one of them is set to display block. We have unordered list and they're
all styled here but the first one has a background color that matches
this thing so it really starts to look like a tab and we want to get
that styling in place. The next step will be to add the jQuery to make
the thing work and we'll start working on that in the next lesson.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to start with writing our script to make our tabbed
interface function.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 224. link to jquery library (132) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

<p>You can see down here at the bottom of the index.html file, I've added
the link to the <b>jQuery</b> library.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 225. #tabs > ul > li > a, click function (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="#tabs > ul > li > a, click function" 
  alt="#tabs > ul > li > a, click function." />

<p>The first thing we want to do here is add some jQuery to gather all of
our anchor tags in here and add it to when you click on these something
happens. Again, we're going to use our jQuery object as always, and in
here again, I want to very specifically target the # tab angle bracket,
ul angle bracket, li angled bracket a.. I want to target those and then
I want to add a click handler, so that when a click happens. Then add an
anonymous function that runs when you click these links. This anonymous
function will run and is always on typing from the outside ends so that
you don't lose any curly braces or semi-colons.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Then I can click inside the curly braces and in here I want to get all
of these anchor tags here, and make it so that the color and the
background color of these are all set to the default background here,
this default color. Then I'm going to take the one that I've clicked and
change its background color and the color of the font.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>Then we can pass in key value pairs that will work with this object. We
set the background and color. We're going to set background and that
doesn't go in quotes because it's the property. We're going to set it
to, this one does go in quotes, pound a2a2a2. We're going to set color,
and its properties can be pound cecece. That's going to set these
colors. They immediately all of them gets set to the color of the background.</p>

<p>If I come over here and test this. As soon as I click on one of these,
you'll see they all turn to that dark color. Then I want to take the one
that I clicked on, this one, and set it to this color here. We'll do
that in the next lesson.</p>

<p>Now we need to turn the background in the color of the font for the one
that we've clicked on. Again, you can only click on one tab at a time so
which one did you click on? You clicked on this one. We're going to use
this keyword, dollar sign this and then we're basically going to do a
CSS command like this here so I'm going to copy that and paste it here
but the colors are going to be different. The background is going to be,
eaeaea I think, and the color is going to be 333, like that and that
should work. Let's save that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 232. test, brownies tab (136) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image232.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test, Brownies tab"
  alt="Test, Brownies tab." />

<p>Now when I click on "Brownies", you can see they're all turning to dark
gray and then this one, the one I clicked on is turning white gray, so
it makes it look like this tab is active. Now we've activated the tab,
but we haven't actually changed the tab content. That's what we're going
to do next, is change the tab content so that when we click on this to
correct tab content shows up here.</p>

<p>How are we going to do that? Well, when we click on one of these,
there's an href attribute associated with this link, with each one of
these links. We know that the href attribute that's associated with
these links is also associated with the content below, because that's
how we had our markup setup over here. Remember up here, we set these
href's here to link to these id's down here. Really what I need to do is
find out what href I clicked on when I clicked on one of these.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 233. const thistab = this.attr 'href' (137) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image233.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="const thisTab = this.attr href"
  alt="const thisTab = this.attr href." />

<p>We can do that very easily down here, again, using this keyword. I'm
going to make a variable var, this tab. I'm going to assign it a value
it can be var it can be constant I'll just use const for now. I'm going
to use the, this keyword I'm going to use in our <b>jQuery</b> object
and I'm going to use.attr, which is the attribute method in
<b>jQuery</b> that allows me to get a particular attribute on an element
and what attribute do you want, I want the href.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 234. test alert, tabs-2 (137) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image234.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test Alert, tabs-2"
  alt="Test Alert, tabs-2." />

<p>Just to see what's gong on with this, if I do alert this tab and see
what I get. When I do this, you come back here and refresh the page. If
I click on "Brownies" I'm getting pound tabs 2, if I click on "Cotton
Candy", I'm getting pant tabs 3. If I click on "cupcakes", I'm getting
pan tabs 1, that's getting me the correct tab, which is exactly what I
want.</p>

<p>Now that we have that working and we're able to click on these and swap
out the correct information there. What do we want to do? How do we want
to actually handle this content here? What I want to do is fade out the
content that's showing for the tab that's selected, then fade in the new
content and that animation is going to be handled by the <b>jQuery</b>
effects library. It's going to happen in 200 milliseconds. But that fade
is important to the interface because it gives the user a clue that the
information is actually changing. That's what we'll do in the next
lesson.</p>

<h2 id="ch2-14">2.14 Whole Script (7:40)</h2>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, The Whole Script"
   alt="Example, The Whole Script." />

<p>What I need to do is get the tab that's currently showing, and we can do
that using <b>jQuery</b>. The most effective way is to use tabs, angle
bracket, div:visible. We've talked about this filter before briefly, and
it will give us whichever one is currently set to display block. That's
the current one that we need to set, and we're just going to set it
to.fadeOut over 200 milliseconds. That will fade out the current one
that's showing. The other ones are all set to display none. Once this
animation is finished, we need to take the one that we've clicked on and
feed it back in.</p>

<p>What we need here is a <b>callback</b> function. Once this is done
fading out, we want to add a callback function, with its parentheses,
and its current devices in here. I want this tab to get faded in. The
way we're going to do is we're going to make use of our variable that
we've already created here. We can use our <b>jQuery</b> object to get
this tab. We know that this thing is going to hold in either pound tab
dash 1 or pound tab dash 2 because that's what we found when we did this
alert. You get this one and then we can do.fadeIn over 200 milliseconds.
We'll fade that one in.</p>

  style="width:50%"
  title="Full script in index.html"
  alt="Full script in index.html." />

<p>Now we have a nice simple script that allows us to capture these
elements and use the <b>jQuery</b> effects library to feed them in and
out. This isn't particularly heavy duty effects libraries stuff. It's
not going to look terrible on mobile or anything like that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test, highlight one tab"
  alt="Test, highlight one tab." />

<p>Let's see if this actually works. Come over here, refresh the page. When
I click on Brownies, it feeds the first one out and feeds the next one
in, and that's working perfectly. Because of the animation, it's giving
us a sense that the content is actually changing. That's a really good
use of animation there and the effects library. That's working great.
Let's just review the whole script. Here we're loading the <b>jQuery</b>
library.</p>

<p>Then in our script, we're getting those anchor tags and adding
clickHandler to notice that a function runs when they're clicked. In the
tabs we are changing all of them to be the default background color, the
unselected color for both the background and the color of the text, then
the one we clicked on we're changing so that it shows the correct color
in text for that one. We figure out, well which link did we click on,
and then we're going to take the corresponding div that goes with that,
fade out the one that's currently showing, and take the corresponding
div and feed it back in.</p>

<p>That's the entire script. It's a nice simple script and does a nice job
of making use of our effects library in <b>jQuery</b> to build something
simple and effective that you could use in lots of websites.</p>

<p>Again, in summary, this is a great use of <b>jQuery</b>, and maybe if
this is the only thing you're putting in your webpage, you'd use
<b>jQuery</b>. It's not really worth it because you're downloading the
entire library just to make these little tabs. We'll see how to do the
same tabs in plain JavaScript, but it's working really great, and if you
are using <b>jQuery</b> for other things on your website, then this
would be really good use for it as well. The last thing to do here is
just, put the script in a separate link file, add the IIFE immediately
invoked function expression closure, and use strict directive, and link
it in the head of the page with the deferred property and do all that
stuff.</p>

  title="Create script.js and populate it with functions from index.html"
  alt="Create script.js and populate it with functions from index.html." />

<p>Here, I can just make a new file called script.js. On that file I can
add my function parentheses, curly braces, and an extra set of
parenthesis at the end to make it run. Then inside the curly braces, I'm
going to use strict directive semicolon, and then I'm going to come back
here and just copy this script from here. Already use const for the one
variable that I have, so I don't really have to do anything with that.
That's all fine, and that should be all good there.</p>

<p>Then back here I can just get rid of the stuff. Instead, I'm going to
move these things up to the top of the page, cut them from here, and
stick them in the head, but again, you have to add the defer attribute
here, like that. Then for this script here, I'm just going to link to my
script tags. I mean just SRC equals quote, script.js, and then don't
forget, <b>defer</b>, and then this thing down here can go up. There we
go. That should all work. Let's just test it really quickly and make
sure it works. Refresh, and it's working great. We've got a nice, clean,
simple script that we can use using <b>jQuery</b>.</p>

<p>To get started I have my files open in visual studio code and you can
notice that it's a little bit different in the setup and then I've added
these classes; <b>visible, hidden, &amp; visuallyhidden</b>. And we're
going to making use of classes because we don't have the J Query effects
library at our disposal. We're going to have to make use of CSS and
classes to do the animation and do the hiding and showing of things. And
we'll use javascript to trigger the changing of these classes.</p>

<p>First over here, I should open up this file here. So I'm just going to
make a new tab and open this file. You can see that it looks the same as
the previous one. I found it a little bit of the styling in here
already.</p>

<p>But the first thing we need to do is get these things styled and the
styling forgetting these things. Style is exactly the same that we did
for the J query tabs. So you could actually go to that project and get
that same styling from there. But over here, I'm just going to come in
and just add, I'm just going to paste it in here. But this is the exact
same rules from the previous version. We're setting for the ordered list
inside the tabs and again we're using the ankle bracket because we want
to target those elements specifically and we're setting them to display
flex so they go next to each other.</p>

<p>And then down here for the anchor tags were setting to display block
height, 30 pixels, line height, 30 pixels which puts the text in the
vertical center margin on the right to pixels and setting the background
color and all that stuff is exactly the same along with the border
radius and all that. So that should all work to get our basic tabs to
look the way we want them to look on our design. And that's really
critical to kind of get started with their.</p>

<p>The rest of the styling that we need is a little bit different. And
basically what we're doing here is I'm making these divs down here.
They're going to be set with padding 15 pixels and a background color
that's that lighter gray. And then the transition is what's going to
actually handle the fading in and fading out of the opacity and we'll
see how that works in the script. But this is where the actual animation
is going to take place is here in CSS. So that's a little bit different.
Then I have a class of active on the current tab up here that's selected
and that's going to get the background color that matches that
background color and the color of the text.</p>

<p>And you can see over on the html if you go look that the current tab
cupcakes is active, it has the class active on here. So in our
JavaScript will be moving that class active to each of these will be
removing it from here and adding in each of these as you click on them
to change them.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>And then we've got a few helper classes down here that will be using hidden 
to set elements to display, not visible to display block and visually hidden. 
Which is going to be the opacity and that's what gets animated down. You'll see 
how this all works in the JavaScript. But for right now we need to add this over 
onto our CSS and you're going to have to type it in. I'm going to paste it so 
you don't have to watch me type it because it's not that interesting to watch me 
type this, but I'm going to paste it in here. But you can stop the lesson and go 
in and add this yourself.</p>

<p>Stop the lesson here and add these rules on your CSS tabs, angle bracket div 
set the pattern to 15 pixels, the background color and transition. We're going 
to be transitioning the opacity over 200 milliseconds using linear easing. So 
it's going to be the same speed all the way through. And then the active class 
on the tabs gets its background color in the color and then we need these three 
little helper rules down at the bottom here. So I'm going to save that. And of 
course, visual studio code likes to have them formatted this way. I kind of prefer 
these all in one line myself because there's just one declaration in each. Little 
easier to read. But that's okay. Well that visual studio code have its way with 
it.</p>

<p>So now we should have the look that we need for our tabs. If I come over here 
and refresh, it looks just like it did before. None of this is actually functioning 
yet. But the look is the same as what we had in the original in the original version 
of the Jacob version, and we'll start working on the JavaScript in the next lesson.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you got all this CSS in place and now you're ready to start working 
on the JavaScript.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 250. script src='script.js' (148) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Script src='script.js'"
  alt="Script src='script.js'." />

<p>I have a linked script file here, and it's linked at the bottom of this file, 
you can see down here. I've got my script file linked.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~ 251. var tabs = document.queryselectorall, #tabs > ul > li > a (149) ~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image251.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Define var tabs = document.querySelectorAll('#tabs > ul > li > a');" 
  alt="Define var tabs = document.querySelectorAll('#tabs > ul > li > a');" />

<p>I'm going to go to that script file and just work directly in here. I'm going 
to use var for right now, and later go in and clean up, and add Latin concentrate. 
But you could use Latin concentrate from the beginning here, but the first thing 
I want to do, is get all of my tabs and put them in a variable. I'm going to make 
a variable var tabs, and set that equal to <span class="showme">document.query 
selectorAll</span>. What do I want to get in here? I want to get very specifically 
the pound tabs, angle bracket, ul, angle bracket, LI, angle bracket a. Those 
elements. Using the elements that I want to get and assign to my tabs variable.</p>

<p>Then I want to add a click handler to all of them, so I'm going to use a
loop for, var i equals zero, or i is less that tabs.length, i plus plus,
curly braces and then down here I'm going to say, okay, tabs square
bracket i, so each tab as we go through this loop, I'm going to add an
event listener and the event listener is going to listen for a click.</p>

<p>And then when the click happens, we could run a function. We could do an
anonymous function like this, and put everything inside of here. But in
this case, it'll be a little bit cleaner to make a separate function, so
I'm going to have a function down here. Function, select tab. I'll leave
it select tab and parentheses, curly braces. Instead of an anonymous
function, I'm going to run select tab, so I can just copy that and still
be here. When you do this, you don't put in the parentheses up here, if
you put in the parentheses, it'll run right away, and I don't want it to
run right away. [inaudible]. I just put the name of this function here
and that will run this function down here. That's going to get us
started with getting our tabs, the next thing we need to do is figure
out what we need to do in here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 252. function selecttab event, preventdefault (150) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="function selectTab(event), preventDefault"
  alt="function selectTab(event), preventDefault." />

<p>What do we need to do in here? The first thing I'm going to do is, I'm
going to pass in the event object here, so I can do
event.preventDefault.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 253. prevent default (150) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image253.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Add 'prevent default' to keep hash from showing up"
  alt="Add 'prevent default' to keep hash from showing up." />

<p>What that will do is make it, so that when you click on the tabs over
here, you don't get the little hash showing up at the end of the URL. I
don't really want that to happen. Prevent default will keep the hash
from showing up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 254. for each tab, remove attributes (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image254.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="For each tab, remove class attributes on tabs"
  alt="For each tab, remove class attributes on tabs." />

<p>Then I need a little bit of a loop, I mean I just do a four loop.
Basically what I want to do is I want to go through and remove an index,
I want to remove, any class that's on any of these links. This one has
the class of active on it. I want to remove the class of active from all
of these and then add it to the one that I clicked, so it gets the
correct class on there. I'm going to use a loop to do that.</p>

<p>In <b>jQuery</b>, we didn't really need to use loops because we could
apply things to groups of elements using your <b>jQuery</b> object, but
in plain JavaScript, we need to loop through and do this. Here I'm going
to add var i equals zero where i is less than tabs dot length, We're
using the same variable that we created up here to the global scope
there and then i plus, plus. Then I'm going to go through and say, okay,
tabs, square bracket, i dot removeAttribute, class. That'll remove the
class attribute from each tab, that'll get rid of all the class attributes.</p>

<p>Then after I'm done with that loop, I want to add it to the one that I
clicked on and I could use this keyword here, but it's easier and better
to use the event object that have already passed in and used with the
prevent default. Can use it again, your event dot target. That will get
this item event.target.className equals active,and that will put the
active class on the one that I clicked, so I'm removing from all of them
and then putting it on the one that I clicked. What we did in one line
of <b>jQuery</b>, writing a little function here to do in plain
JavaScript, but that should work, let's go over and test it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 255. test console, click active (152) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image255.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Test Console, click active"
  alt="Test Console, click active." />

<p>If I refresh this and click “Cotton Candy”, you can see it's getting the
correct class on there. If I inspect, and look at my elements here, you
can see that one has the class of active on it. But then when I click on
these, that class goes away on that one, but now it's been added here,
so that one has class of active. We can see it moving around that class
actives to each one of these. So we've done half our project. We've made
it so that you can click on these tabs and have the correct classes. It
looks like it's doing that, now we have to actually make the content
work. We'll do that in the next lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch2-17">2.17 New Tab and Old Tab (7:20)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 256. new tab and old tab (2.17) (152) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image256.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:40%"
  title="2.17 New Tab and Old Tab"
  alt="2.17 New Tab and Old Tab." />

<p>Now that we have the actual tabs working properly, we want to do
something with our actual tab content to get it display, we have to do
something with the new tab that we've clicked on and the old tab that is
going to go away.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 257. grab attributes for each tab (153) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image257.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Grab attributes for each tab"
  alt="Grab attributes for each tab." />

<p>The first thing we're going to do is make a variable here, for this tab and 
we're going to make that equal to event that target. Again, the one that we 
clicked on, event.target.getAttribute. We want to get the href attribute so 
that will get the href of the length that we collect and put it into this step.</p>

<p>And then we want to get that element. So I'm going to have another variable 
<b>thisContent</b> and that's going to equal 
<span class="showme">document.querySelector(thisTab)</span>.</p>

<p>And then we want to go get that div for whichever one was clicked and again 
only one of these can be clicked. So if you click on brownies it's going to get 
the class active.</p>

<p>So we've got those two things and we're going to hold off on those for a minute 
and let them do their own thing in a minute. But now we need to do something with 
the old tab and get its content, so we know what we're, what we're going to do 
with that one.</p>

<p>We will add another variable var oldContent and I'm going to have that
equal <span class="showme">document.querySelector('.visible');</span>. Now, in 
jQuery we had the colon visible filter that would get visible tabs. But here 
since we're not using jQuery, instead each of these tabs has a class of either 
'hidden' or 'visible' on it. This one is 'visible'.</p>

<p>What we're going to do is swap these classes around, so that when we click on 
one of the tabs one is visible and the other hidden. But we have to do an 
intermediary step to get the animation and fade out. What we're going to do is 
we're going to set its class name to 'visuallyhidden' and its opacity to zero.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 258. css #tabs, hidden, visible & visuallyhidden (154) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image258.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Add #tabs, hidden, visible and visuallyhidden"
  alt="Add #tabs, hidden, visible and visuallyhidden." />

<p>And that will trigger this animation which fades that opacity down to
zero over 200 milliseconds. Old content.class name equals 
<b>'visually hidden'</b>, make sure it matches how you spelled visually
hidden over here. That is set to <b>visuallyhidden</b>. It's still on the
screen, but it's just been transitioned down to the opacity of zero, so
you can't see it anymore.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 259. capture old content (154) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image259.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Capture oldContent"
  alt="Capture oldContent." />

<p>Then what we need to do is we actually need to add an event listener to
this old content. And when that animation that transition has finished,
we need to do something with it, we're going to take it off, we're going
to set it back to its basically display none at that point.</p>

<p>And in jQuery, we have these great <b>callback</b> functions after the
effects library does its effects that we can use. But here we don't have
that instead what we're going to use as an event listener. So I'm going
to put an event listener on old content to out event listener and the
event that we're going to listen for is transition. And this be sure you
get this right transition and it's not transitioned. Its transition and
the end of the transition and make sure you get that right. Because when
I've done this assignment with students in the past that's frequently
where things go wrong, people put transitioned, which kind of makes
sense. But it's actually transition yet.</p>

<p>Okay, so once this content the transition has ended, so transition and
we're listening for that end of that CSS transition, it's pretty cool
that we can do this in javascript is listen for the end of the
transition, a CSS transition. We're going to run a function that's curly
braces and a semi colon. And in this function we're just going to set
the class name on this too after it's transitioned so that it's
invisible. We're just going to set the class name old content that class
name equals hidden, because now we can just say display blocking on and
we've transitioned it down to opacity zero. Now we can just set it so
displaying nine instead of display block at that point.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image261.png"

  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Handling the Switch"
  alt="Example, Handling the Switch." />

<p>We've taken the old content. What was the element that had visible on it? And 
we've set its class to 'visuallyhidden' and that fades it out. That sets it down 
so its opacity is at zero over 200 milliseconds (2 tenths of a second). When
that transition has ended, we're going to run a function to set it, so that it's 
completely hidden. And that just sets it to display none.</p>

<p>Now, we want to set the new content to be visible, but with the current 
opacity at zero. So, after a very short time out, we'll set its opacity to 
one, so that it fades in.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 262. assigning visible and visuallyhidden classes (157) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image262.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Assigning visible and visuallyHidden classes"
  alt="Assigning visible and visuallyHidden classes." />

<p>Let's do that here. We're going to come down here and we already have a
variable this content so we can use that. This content. This is our new
content. We're going to set its class name. We're going to give it to
classes. Were going to give it the class of visible. I think I spell
that right. And visually hidden.</p>

<p>So visible will set it to display block, so that it's on the page. But
visually hidden will set it so that it's opacity is at zero. And then we
need to wait just a split second. And then get rid of the visually
hidden class, so that the opacity comes up to 100%.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="SetTimeout(function(){}, 20);"
  alt="SetTimeout(function(){}, 20);" />

<p>And to make it wait, we're going to use a method in Javascript that we
haven't talked about yet. And we'll get more into this in a future
lesson, but this is a good place to introduce it. We're going to use set
time out. And set time out well, wait a certain amount of time to do
something. And basically what we can do is we can pass it to function.
That's going to run, over a certain amount of time. I was just going to
wait a split second like 20 milliseconds. Very short amount of time just
to let that thing come on the page, get the class set and then remove
the class. So this function will run. This callback function will run
after 20 milliseconds.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 264. wait 20, remove visually hidden image (158) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  style="width:50%"
  title="Wait 20 secs, remove visually hidden image"
  alt="Wait 20 secs, remove visually hidden image." />

<p>So I'm just going to click in the curly braces there. What am I going to
do here? I'm going to do this content. Got class list. Done. I move, I
think that works. I think I did that right. Visually hidden. You can
spell that, right? So that should wait 20 milliseconds and remove the
visually hidden class on their. Alright, we're ready to give this a try.
You'll notice that there's a terrible bug that we need to fix. But it
should be mostly working and then we'll fix the bug.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>So let's give this a try real quick here. Refresh the page and if I
spelled everything right. It's fading that one in and switching my tab,
click on that one and it works, it's great. But then if I click another
one again. I start getting this kind of weird blinking screen going on.
What the heck is up with that? That is not what I was expecting at all.
Alright, cool. I'm going to refresh this, so I don't have that going on.
Okay, we're going to fix this and look at sort of the solution for
fixing that in the next lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch2-19">2.19 Fixing a Bug (6:19)</h2>

<p>We got our tabbed interface working, but you probably noticed that we
had a pretty severe bug.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 267. 10-29 function before capture (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image267.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Lines 10-29 of function before capture"
  alt="Lines 10-29 of function before capture." />

<p>Where it works once clicking on the tabs, but once we click on them a
second time, we get this weird flashing thing going on. So what's going
on with that? Well, the real problem has to do with this transition and
EventListener, because we've added the transition and EventListener. And
it works when you click on the links the first time, it's looking for
that transition end.</p>

<p>But that EventListener's getting added onto old content each time you
click on it. So all of a sudden when you're clicking on it a second
time, it's firing a second time and running again and it ends up in this
weird loop where it's doing this kind of thing. So what do we do about
that? What we can do is at the end of this EventListener down here after
the function.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 268. lines 10-29 of script.js (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image268.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Line 10-29 of script.js"
  alt="Line 10-29 of script.js." />

<p>So this function opens here and closes at this curly brace here after
this function for it that runs when the transition it. We can put a
comma and another object, so another set of curly braces in there. And
there's actually three settings that we can add to the AddEventListener
that will help us work with these different pieces here. And what they
are are capture, False, once:true, and passive:false.</p>

<p>The only one we really care about here is this once:true. What once:true
does is it says add this EventListener once, and then when you're done
with it, remove it, so that will get rid of that. Get rid of that
problem, capture and passive, they're all false by default. If you don't
put this thing in here at all, then they're all here but they're all
false by default.</p>

<p>So we're leaving these two as false but we're making this one true, we
have to put these two in if we're going to just change this one. So we
pass in this little object here that has capture:false, once:true,
passive:false. And if we save that and come back and refresh the page
over here. Now you'll notice that I can click on it and it will run, but
it's dispensing of that EventListener after the first time. So now when
I click on it again, it's just doing it properly. It's getting rid of
the old EventListener and adding the new one and only gets added once.</p>

<p>So now at this point we have a working functional script over here. We
can look at the script and it's a lot more complicated than the
<b>jQuery</b> version. I think we can all agree that this script is a
lot more complicated in the <b>jQuery</b> version. And part of your
decision as to which one you would want to use if you wanted to include
such an interface on a project of one sort or another is, is it worth
including the entire <b>jQuery</b> library in order to have a shorter
script here? Or is it better to have the longer script and make use of
CSS and do this kind of stuff?
</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Lines 1-22 of script function." />

<p>Now we can do a few more things to make this a little bit better, and to
make it a little bit more efficient and perhaps a little bit shorter and
easier to read and all that stuff. So we're going to add those things in
next. The first thing of course, is to just do our best practices and
add in here our IIFE, our immediately invoked function expression,
(function( ){}();. And then in here we can put our use strict directive,
like so. And then we can just make some room here and we can move this
whole script into there.</p>

<p>And of course we can go through and we can change <b>var</b> to
<b>const</b> if you didn't do that right from the beginning, that could
be <b>const</b>. This one has to be <b>let</b> because it's inside of a
loop. Down here this one needs to be <b>let</b>. And then these can be
<b>const</b> here.</p>

<p>But there are a few more things that I want to show you that we can do
with this script to make it a little bit better and a little bit more
modern. And there are things that we're going to talk about in more
detail in a later lesson. But I think it's good to introduce them in
these small projects that you can get used to them before we talk about
the theories behind them and really delve into them in more depth. I
think it's nice to come into that kind of conversation with a little bit
of experience with them. So we'll look at those features of Javascript
next.</p>

<p>There's some things about it that are always going to be a little bit
confusing inherited this transition and thing with that capture in once
and for, all that stuff down there, as well as using set-time-out to
have to wait a split-second before swapping the classes to get the
transition to work properly. But there are few things that we can do to
clean up the code a little bit and make it a little bit better.</p>

<p>Again, you don't have to do any of this, you could leave the script the
way it is, it works fine, the way it is. These are just some things that
are worth looking at and thinking about in terms of syntax for
JavaScript. We'll get into these features in more depth later. This is
just a good opportunity to introduce them. One of them is the for each
method which can work on arrays.

<p>Tabs is an array because it's going in and getting all of these tabs,
and there's just three of them, but it's an array. The for loop is fine.
It works fine, but it's a little bit hard to read and a little bit
cumbersome. The <b>forEach</b> method is a little bit nicer. Let's just
try that and see how that looks instead. What we would do is we would
say <b>tabs.forEach</b> like this. This is the <b>forEach</b> method.
The <b>forEach</b> method, again, it's an array method, so it works on
arrays. We do <b>tabs.forEach</b>, and we pass in a <b>callback</b>
function that runs.</p>

<p>This function takes a variable that's going to work on each element and
tabs and you can call it Eachtab, where you can call it tab. I'm just
going to call and tab. It's going to do something with tab. It's going
to go through each of the tabs and do something with tab. What are we
going to do here? We're going to say, okay tab.addEventListener, and
we're going to do click.</p>

<p>Then we're going to run this selectTab down here. This piece of code is
doing exactly the same thing as this for loop here. You could either
comment this out or deleted altogether and just use the forEach method
here that will allow us to add an EventListener to each tab. I just
think it's a little bit easier to read. Again, we'll get into this more
later, but this is a good place to introduce it.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing down here in place of this for loop down here
as well. We get even just paste this in, but instead of adding an event
listener, we can just do this instead. But instead of tabs dash, the
square bracket i, it's just tab, tab.removesAttribute class. Again,
we're just replacing this for loop with that. That should work just as
well as before. Let's go over just test this really carefully here. If I
refresh this and test it, you can see that it's working exactly the same
as it did before. You can get rid of these things here.</p>

<p>Now, even further in JavaScript, there is now a, something called an era
of function. And if you've looked up I JavaScript online, you've
probably come across arrow functions before. Again, we're going to get
more into arrow functions and talk about them in more in depth in a
future lesson. But this is a good place to introduce them because we
could even further clarify these little functions here with arrow
functions.</p>

<p>The way they work is like this, you get rid of the word function, and
instead over here you put what they call an arrow, which is really just
an equals sign integrator that sign in here. If you're passing in only
one variable, you can get rid of the parentheses. Now we have
<b>tabs.forEach</b> <b>tab</b>, and then this becomes the function that
runs. Now, we could do the same thing down here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 275/276. script.js code (165) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Lines 13-32 of script.js." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Again, we're going to do this in more depth later to talk about arrow
functions and when do you use them and when not to use them and what
they're good for. It just gives us a clear <b>tabs.forEach tab</b>. You
could even move this up, so it's all on one line. That helps with the
clarity of the script.</p>

<p>Again, you don't have to do any of this stuff if you don't want to. The
script worked perfectly fine before. There's nothing wrong with using
the <b>for loop</b> and now using the <b>forEach</b> or using the
<b>arrow</b> functions. But it just seemed like this would be a good
place to introduce those ideas.</p>

<p>Just to summarize the lesson, we've created a typical tabbed interface,
and we've done it with plain JavaScript. It's a little bit different
than the version that we did in <b>jQuery</b>, and ultimately, you have
to decide whether including the <b>jQuery</b> library and doing the
shorter script is worth it. It's not that long, it's not that bad, it's
certainly a lot less code to download than the entire <b>jQuery</b> library.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you're using <b>jQuery</b> for other things in
your project already, then using it for the <b>tabs</b> doesn't actually
add any extra weight, and it works. It is short and quick and right to
the point. This is a great example of the difference between JavaScript
and <b>jQuery</b>.</p>

<p>If this helps you get used to working with JavaScript and more excited
about learning it, then by all means, use the <b>jQuery</b>. If you
prefer to learn the plain vanilla JavaScript because <b>jQuery</b> is
starting to get phased out, then this is a good example of the work you
need for it with plain JavaScript.</p>

<p>Welcome to the third module in our second course in JavaScript. In this
module, you'll create some scripts that are useful and that you can put
on actual webpages. Plus they'll build your skills and you'll get better
at working with JavaScript and <b>jQuery</b>, they provide a lot of
practice. Let's dive in and start working on these scripts. I think
you're going to get a lot out of them and I look forward to going

<p>Learning JavaScript and <b>jQuery</b> is the most fun when you're
working on projects that you could actually use. In this lesson, we're
going to make a basic image slider that you could put on any website.
Plus, along the way, you'll learn some new things about <b>jQuery</b>
and JavaScript and get a lot of practice.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Final Project"
  alt="Final Project." />

<p>Let's move forward and see how this project works here. The final
project you'll have just a simple little slideshow where the images will
slide from left to right or they'll come in from the right-hand side and
slide over to the left-hand side as you go to the next image and then
the other way round as you go to the previous image. We'll see how that
actually works and how it comes out as we move along here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image281.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Start Folder"
  alt="Start Folder." />

<p>In the start folders, you download the files that go with the assignment. In 
the Start Folder, you'll find there's an index HTML file, we've got a script 
file, and we've got a folder with some slides with some images that I took up 
at Bodie National Park which is an old abandoned ghost town. It's a pretty 
interesting place. Great place to take a lot of great photos. I took some photos 
up there, so we'll use some of those for this project.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, HTML for the Folder"
  alt="Example, HTML for the Folder." />

<p>If we come over and look at the index file, you'll notice that we have a <b>div</b> 
with an ID of slider, and then an unordered list with list items for each of the 
images for the slides in the slideshow. This is actually a fairly common setup that 
you will find for image slider scripts that you might find around the web. Then 
I've just got some links for the previous and next buttons.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>If we come over here and look at that HTML, you'll see that that's what it 
looks like here. I'm loading my normalized script. I've got my CSS. I've got 
<b>jQuery</b> loaded here. I'm loading an easing plugin that we'll talk about 
in a bit. Then we've got our script file here, and then we've got our slides. 
That's all there. I've got a script file here which is empty. It's where we're 
going to write our JavaScript, and then we've got some styles that we'll talk 
about in just a minute here.</p>

<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image285.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Project Strategy"
  alt="Project Strategy." />

<p>The important way to think about this or the important strategy here is
that the images are all going to be lined up in a row.</p>

<p>What we have as the actual window, the <b>slider</b> <b>div</b>, is
going to have overflow hidden on it so that you can't see the other
images, and it's going to be set to position relative so that we can
absolutely position the string of images, the strip of images inside
that window. The current image will be displaying and when you click
"Next", the next image will slide in or if you click "Previous", the
previous image will slide in. That strip will basically slide back and
forth left and right as we move through the slides.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 286. example, check out the styles (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image286.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Check Out the Styles"
  alt="Example, Check Out the Styles." />

<p>Now, one thing to check out is the way that the styling works, and it's
really important to understand the way HTML and CSS works because it's
these tools that will provide the basic content and structure for our
pages, and even though we're learning JavaScript, and that has to do
with the behavior, the behavior very much is affected by the layout and
the content of the pages.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 287. id slider, overflow hidden, position relative (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image287.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Id slider, overflow hidden, position relative"
  alt="Id slider, overflow hidden, position relative." />

<p>If we come over here and look at this, the overflow hidden on this
slider element here, which is, again, if we go back to the index here,
it's this <b>div</b> here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 288. html, div id slider, ul li with images (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image288.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="HTML, div id='slider', unordered list, list items with slideshow images"
  alt="HTML, div id='slider', unordered list, list items with slideshow images." />

<p>If I come and look at the page, it's this <b>div</b> here that has the
picture in it. That div has overflow hidden on it and it is showing only
the slide that is in the window and the width of it is set to the same
width as the actual images. The height is set to the same height and
then it's set to position relative so we can use absolute positioning.</p>

<p>If you know some CSS and you know about positioning, you know that when
you set a parent to relative positioning, then the child set to absolute
positioning is going to be set in relation to that parent element.
Position 0, top zero, left zero puts that thing inside this container
here. Then display flex is what makes all the images go into a row. Top
zero, left zero puts that in the top left corner.</p>

  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Images Lined Up"
  alt="Example, Images Lined Up." />

<p>Now, if I were to go in and mess with this just a little bit, you can
see what it will do. For example, if I take overflow hidden out of my
slider declaration here. Let's do this just to see what happens.</p>

  title="Slideshow test, without overflow hidden"
  alt="Slideshow test, without overflow hidden." />

<p>If I come over here to my styles and remove <b>overflow</b>
<b>hidden</b> just temporarily, you'll see that the other slides are all
lined up. Each one is on there next to each other and they're all lined
up here. Just because of overflow hidden, we're not seeing them. We're
only seeing what's actually in the window. We want to go back and put
overflow hidden back so we're not seeing those additional slides. We're
only seeing the one that's actually in the window. It's important to
understand that that's how this project is set up because it has an
effect on how we write our JavaScript.</p>

<p>One thing we want to do as we're working on our scripts is we want to make them 
as general as possible, so that if we were to add more images into our slider 
then our script to be able to handle them.</p>

<p>I'm going to use some variables to keep track of some things like, well, how 
many images do I actually have in my slider? I know right now that it's five, 
and I could just leave it at that, for image count, but I could just set image 
count to five. It really rather have it actually find out what is the length of 
my element here.</p>

<p>Then I also want to find out how wide is my image, and I'm going to assume 
that all my images are the same width because the slider won't look right if 
they're not anyway. I'm going to assume that all these images are the same width, 
but I need to find out how wide is one of them.</p>

<p>Let's add these two variables to our script over here. I'm going to come
back to Visual Studio code and go to my script file, and here I can just
add in const. What did I set this for? I set this variable to image
count. How many images do I have? I'm going to set variable image count,
I'm going to make it equal to slider, length.</p>

<p>It's <b>"#slider ul li</b>" dot length, and that will actually go in to
my document over here (right image) and look for this slider element,
and then find the list items, and we'll find out how many are there.
That should return to me, a five in this case.</p>

number that tells me how wide might first image is. Let's see what that
does, alert <b>imageWidth</b>. I'm getting 400. It's telling me that
it's 400 pixels wide.</p>

<p>Before I move on, I'm looking at my slide here and realize I'm using
this first pseudo-class here to get the first list item. What that does
is it goes into the <span class="showme">DOM</span> here, and it looks at the first one of these
list items and then gets the image. Now, as it turns out, <b>jQuery</b>
has deprecated this first pseudo-class.</p>

<p>If you look this up on the <b>jQuery</b> website, it'll say deprecated.
They don't want to use this, instead, they want to use the first method.
Let's do that. I'll just do <b>jQuery: first</b>, in Google Search. You
will see as of <b>jQuery</b> 3.4, the first pseudo-class is deprecated.
Remove it from your selectors in filter results using dot first instead.</p>

<p>It's important when you're using a library like <b>jQuery</b> to stay up
on sort of the latest trends with language as best you can, it's not
always easy to, this one slipped by me when I made this slide, but I'm
aware of it now. I'm going to fix it here in the lesson. I'm going to
come over here and get rid of first here, and instead use <b>first</b>
like that. That should give me the same result.</p>

<p>Let's check it. If I come over, I'm still getting 400. It is important
to pay attention to these things as you can. I should add, while this
still works currently in the current version of <b>jQuery</b>, it might
not work in future versions of <b>jQuery</b>. Since I'm loading this
version of <b>jQuery</b> up at this project, unless I update my link to
<b>jQuery</b> to a newer version, it will continue to work. This is
actually fine to use for now with the current version of <b>jQuery</b>
that we have, but going forward, we should use the dot <b>first</b>
method instead. I just wanted to show you that.</p>

to find out how wide the images are, we'd run before the images are downloaded 
and I could get a zero there, and I don't want that.</p>

<p>I want to make sure I'm getting the actual images. What I want to do to prevent 
that problem from happening is I want to add an <b>EventListener</b> that checks 
to see when all of the assets for the page have downloaded and it's not going to 
run the script until they are. We can use the <b>on</b> method in <b>jQuery</b> 
and the <b>on</b> method in <b>jQuery</b> is similar to the <b>addEventListener</b> 
method that we have in plain JavaScript and then you pass in a particular event 
that you're looking for. Then it'll run a function when that event happens.</p>

<p>Here we're going to put the <b>on method</b> on the window object and
the window itself. We're looking for a <b>load</b> event and this
<b>callback</b> function will run when <b>load</b> is completed, meaning
all of the images for the page have downloaded. That will keep the
script from running until the images are actually there.</p>

<p>Let's add this onto our script and we're going to put everything inside
this window load function for our page. I'm going to add my
<b>jQuery</b> object and I'm going to pass in the window object. I'm
going to use <b>on</b> and I'm going to look for the <b>load</b> event,
and then I'm going to run a <b>callback</b> function. Then everything's
going to go inside of these curly braces here.</p>

<p>While I'm here, this function here, will work as a closure for the page
for this function. This thing is all in its own closure, we can add our
<b>use strict</b> directive, right here. We don't need to make a
separate IIFE, the Immediately Invoked Function Expression. We don't
need that because we want this function to run when the page has loaded
all its files. When it has, then we can say, okay, now you can run, and
we're going to set up these variables in alert.</p>

<p>We should still be getting 400 but you can see that the image started
actually coming in because before that alert ran.That's one thing that's
slightly different is that it's actually loading the images first.
Because we are loading from our hard drive, it's not that big of a deal.</p>

<p>Next, we're going to add a few more variables to our project. We need to
know the total width of our whole slider. For that we're going to take
the image count and multiply it by the width of each image. That will
give us our total width plus we'll add a px to the end of that.</p>

<p>Let's go ahead and add that to our script now. I'm going to get rid of
this alert and just to const totalWidth, and this is going to be equal
to <b>imageWidth</b> times imageCount. Doesn't matter which way around
it goes right, it's going to come up and same thing. Then we're going to
add onto that a px at the end of there, that's going to put that in
there. Then let's just alert out total width which is to see what we're
getting here.</p>

<p>I'm going to come back here and now when I refresh, I'm getting 2,000
pixels because I've got five images, each of them is 400 pixels wide,
that's 2,000 pixels. That's adding up and doing that properly, which is

<p>Next, I'm going to need a variable for left position. This variable can
be changed in the process of running the script. I'm going to set it
with the keyword let and I'm going to have a counter that's also going
to change. Then I'm going to set the width of my slider UL to be that
total width. We'll talk about that in just a minute here, let's go ahead
and add these in. Let position equals zero, let counter equals zero,
then I'm going to use my <b>jQuery</b> object to go in and say, Okay
pound slider ul.css. Your width is going to be total width. Let's stop
the lesson here and then we'll talk about this more in the next lesson.</p>

<p>If we go over to the styles, you'll see on here that the slider
<b>UL</b> isn't given a specific width, but I want to add a width to it
because that will make sure that when I set it to <b>display flex</b>
that everything fits properly inside this <b>UL</b>.</p>

<p>Adding that to the script ensures that the slider is going to be the
exact width that I need it to be, 2000 pixels.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to add our click handlers and make the script work. We
need a click handler for that next button. And when you click the next
button, we're going to increase the counter. The counter is going to go
from zero to 1 and then we're going to set the left position to a -400
pixels. We take that counter and we multiply it by the image width; 1 *
400 is 400 and we're going to put a - in front of it because we're going
to move it a - 400 pixels.</p>

<p>Let's add this into our script over here again. The best way to do this
is to type from the outside in. I'm going to add an event listener like this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>I'm going to start with my <b>jQuery</b> object and then I want to get
the element that I want to work on my pound next element which if we go
back to the index file here is this link.</p>

<p>Right here <b>id</b> equals <b>next</b> for this link when you click on this 
button that says next. When we click on that, we want to have a click <b>event</b> 
<b>handler</b>. And then we're going to pass in an <b>anonymous</b> function that 
runs when you click function, parentheses, curly braces, click between the curly 
braces and move that down.</p>

<p>So when we're here now, we're going to take <b>counter</b>, and
increment it plus plus. So <b>counter</b> has now gone from zero to 1
and we're going to set the position of the of that <b>slider</b> over to
the left -400 pixels. So we'll set leftPosition. That variable there is
going to be set equal to counter times image width and it should be a
negative number, counter times <b>imageWidth</b> a negative so that's
going to give me a -400 and then I also need plus <b>PX</b> and that
will set that left position to what I need it to be.</p>

<p>I think it's a little bit easier to read if I use my tick marks, put the
whole thing inside of tick Marks and then I'm going to use the dollar
sign and the curly braces. $ and curly braces like that. So I've got
<b>counter</b> times <b>imageWidth</b>. So I'm using my string literal
here to get to give me a negative to counter multiply by image width.
That's going to generate a 400 and put a negative there and put a
<b>px</b> at the end. That will set the left position.</p>

<p>It'll look like this. We're going to go get that slider and we're going to 
animate the left property to left position, which we know is going to be when 
you click it the first time it's going to be -400. When you click it the next 
time it's going to be -800. When you click it the next time it's going to be 
-1200. It's going to move over 400 pixels each time.</p>

<p>For each image, we'll set it to a speed of 700 milliseconds and then we'll 
use the <b>easeinQuad</b> <b>easing</b> method of the <b>easing</b> plugin 
already put into the project.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>Next, I'm going to get pound slider UL and perform the animate method on
it, our custom animate. And in there we're going to pass in an object
and we'll get more into objects and how they work in a later lesson. But
for right now it's just takes key value pairs. We're going to animate
the left property and what are we going to animate it to? We're going to
animate it to the <b>leftPosition</b>, which the first time you click
the button will be -400, then a comma and then I'm going to say 700
because that's the only property I'm actually animating.</p>

<p>700 milliseconds is how quickly it's animating and I'm going to do
<b>easeInQuad</b>, which is the easing that I have selected for this
particular animation. You could do a different one if you wanted to, but
that will get the correct animation. And that needs to go inside quotes.
Now with that, this should be somewhat functioning. It'll function until
we get to the end of the end of the strip.</p>

<p>Let's give it a try over here. Now if I click next, it will animate
right to the correct spot, and then it goes to the next one, and then it
goes to the next one, and then it goes to the next one. And if I click
it on the last one, it animates right outside (see image) of the strip.
The entire strip is off to the left over here. That's what we'll need
to fix next.</p>

<p>In the previous lesson, we got our click handler working. So that you
can click on the the button, and the images will move forward and the
slider will function. But when you get to the end of the strip slides
right outside the slider window. Which is not really what we want.</p>

<p>What we need is an if statement to make this work. We're going to add an if 
statement to check to see, if the counter is the same as <b>imageCount</b>.
And if it is, then we're going to set <b>imageCount</b> back to zero. And that 
will put the strip right back to the beginning. What we want is remember 
<b>imageCount</b> saying how many images we have. So it's five. We want a number 
that's either, we want count to either be zero, one, two, three or four. As soon 
as it hits five, then we're out of range and we want to put it back to the 
beginning.</p>

  title="Next button, if counter = imageCount then ..."

<p>Let's add this "if statement" into our script over here, to handle that. Down 
here, I'm going to increment the <b>imageCount</b> and then check to see if the counter is 
the same as image count. If it is, reset the counter back to zero equals the same 
as you could also do triple equals. Which would be exactly the same as, in this 
case I'm not really worried about type coercion. But you might want to be extra 
careful and triple equals in there, and there we go.</p>

<p>Now if we come back and test this, refresh the page, when I click
next, it'll go all the way through my slides. And when I get to the last
one it goes back to the beginning. And that will continue to work, as we
go forward through the script.</p>

<p>Now your job is to think about what you could do to create the click
handler for the previous button. Because currently this button doesn't
have anything going on with it here. It doesn't have any event listener
at all. So, we need to add an event listener for this. That will make
the slides trip go, the other way.</p>

<p>Now, the way to think about this, is to start with thinking about what
happens if you're at the end. Website went too far. There we go. If
we're at the end of the strip and we click previous, we want to document
the counter. And move the strip the other direction. Think about what
you could do, to create your own event listener for the previous click
button. And then we'll take a look at it together in the next lesson and
see if you got the same answer I got.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Previous Image Click Handler"
  alt="Example, Previous Image Click Handler." />

<p>This is the answer I came up with. I have an event handler looking for
that Previous button and click on that Previous button. Then take the
counter and decremented by 1. Here the if statement is going to change
so that if the counter is less than 0, then I'm going to set the counter
to image count minus 1. I don't want to set it to five and want to set
it to four because remember our counter needs to be a zero, a one, a
two, a three or a four for our five images. If the counter is less than
0, then it's out of range. Then we want to put it in range by putting it
at the end of the strip.</p>

<p>The way to think about it is to think about it from the right end of the
strip, the right-hand end or a fifth image, so that if we're on the
fifth image, we're going to decrement to four and then we're going to
decrement it to three and then to two, and then to one and then when we
get to under zero, we're going to set it back to the last image. Then
we're going to leave the <b>leftPosition</b>. These two pieces
(<b>counter</b> and <b>imageWidth</b>) stay exactly the same. In fact,
we could actually make the script, make this event handler by copying
and pasting the next, because a bunch of it is the same.</p>

<p>What we're changing here is instead of <b>next</b>, we're changing this
to <b>previous</b>. The character instead of getting incremented, gets
decremented minus minus. Then instead of setting counter, checking to
see if it's the same as image count, we're going to see, is it less than
zero? If it's less than zero, then we're going to set it to image count
minus one.</p>

<p>Remember we're talking about an array here. We want our counter to be a
zero, a one, a two, a three or a four. But when it's five, that's too
high. Image count is going to be five in this case because we have five
images. Last two command lines remain the same.</p>

<p>Come back here, refresh the page. Our next button works, our previous

the beginning. If I'm somewhere in the middle here and I click
"Previous" and then click "Previous" again, it will go all the way to
the end and there we go. I can go next and previous and I can go.</p>

<p>Basically this is a strip of photos that's moving back and forth inside
of this window. Here you have a basic image slider that you could style
and work with images on your website for any website you want. You just
want to make sure that your images are all set up to be the same size to
begin with and it'll work. You could have as many of them in there as you.</p>

that goes to the end and then brings you back to the beginning and works
as a strip. We're going to take this thing and make it so that it wraps

kind of a nice effect if this thing wraps around like that.</p>

<p>We're going to take the same set as files that we've already worked
on and we're going to rework them to create this next version of the
slideshow. And by the way, this is a great way to learn JavaScript, is
to make a small project and then look at it and go, what could what
could I do to make this a little bit better and work on ways of revising
it to improve it and make it a little bit better.</p>

<p>How are we going to make it wrap around? What we're going to do is we're
going to basically clone the entire strip of slides. So that if we look
at this top picture here, if you click the next button all the way till
you get to the last slide in the strip of slides, we're going to clone
the entire unordered list, the UL. Which is the unordered list with all
the slides in it.</p>

<p>We're going to clone it and tack it on the end. So that when you click
next again, this one slides into place and it's on the first slide.
Then, we can remove the one, remove the unordered list that was there
before and it will go away, and we're right back where we started with a
strip of slides on the first slide and we can keep going forward.</p>

<p>And then if you click the reverse, the previous button, it's just going
to do the same thing in reverse. Instead of tacking it on at the end
here, it'll tack it on at the beginning. So that way, we will always
have kind of an unending loop of slides, whether you're going forward or
backwards through the slides. That's the basic strategy that we're going
to use to make this thing work.</p>

handler and make it a little bit different from what we had before.
We're going to add an else statement in. The if statement is going to
handle the cloning of that unordered list. And what happens when we get
to the end? But the else is going to handle what happens if we're just
on a slide in between, in which case we're just going to move forward in
our slides.</p>

<p>So this is the exact same code that we had before. We're just going to
move it so that it's inside of an else statement. So let's go over to
our files. And here, I have, nothing has really changed here. This is
the exact same set of files that I had at the end of the previous
script, the previous version of this slider. And in here, I'm going to
just come down to my next click handler. I'm going to add an else in
here. Else like that. I'm going to move this stuff Into the else. We're
going to do something very different here, and we'll take a look at
what's next in the next lesson.</p>

<p>The next thing what we are going to do, is we are going to clone the on
ordered list.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Cloning the Unordered List"
  alt="Example, Cloning the Unordered List." />

<p>Using the jQuery clone method, you can see here, we have got a clone
method that allow us to take that entire un ordered list to make a clone
of it. And then we are going to append it to the slider that will put it
at the end of the element slider.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 335/336. code in index.html (200) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>So what that will do if we come over and look at our code here, if I
look at my index here is it will take this entire a unordered list and
make a copy of it, and stick it right here like that. That is going to
end up looking like that when it is done when it is done cloning and
appending. That is what it is going to do sort of in code rather than
physically adding the <b>html</b> like I just did there. So it is going
to add that on there, it is going to clone it, and then appended to the
slider and then I need to set the CSS of that of that second. A new
ordered list.</p>

<p>The last one I am going to set the left to image with plus pixels so it
is going to be positioned right here because, this is our little window.
So it is going to say, okay left, since the images 400 pixels wide, it
is going to set the left at 400 pixels. That will put the corner, the
left corner right up against the edge here, which is exactly where we
want it to be.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how would I know about cloning in jQuery? You can
go to the jQuery documentation for all the different things that you can
use with jQuery, and it is just a matter of looking through and seeing
what the different functions are, and what they do and looking them up.</p>

<p>Let us add this to our script. I am going to go back to my script file here, and 
you can leave the counter in if you want. All this stuff is going to come before 
the counter. We are going to do the counter thing at the very end. You can leave 
the counter in if you want or you can take it out and put it back in at the end. 
It does not really matter. But I mean you use my jQuery object to go get pound
slider, and get the U L. The site pound sider in ordered list. And then
I am going to clone it dot clone. And that will make a clone of that
annoy ordered list.</p>

<p>And then I need to append that clone. Two slider, pound slider. Do not
forget the pound sign, send it to pound slider. And that will actually
make when when we get to the last slide that will make a clone of it and
put it on there. And then, I need to set the position for that one. I am
going to say again, I am going to get my jQuery object town slider. You
will but I want to get the last one.</p>

<p>Now I have to so I want to get last. We are going to use this last
method again, I am going to get the last one, and I am going to set at
CSS, and I am going to set the left position left. And what am I going
to set it to you? I am going to set it to image with, yes. Image with
plus I probably need pixels on there. Right, image with plus PX, right
image with plus quote PX. And that will put it in exactly the correct
spot here on the page. That will put it so it shows up at the end. The
next lesson will handle the animation.</p>

<p>Before I do the animation, I want to set the variable left position
equal to a value where I'm going to move that first unordered list to.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 340. example, setting the left position (202) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Example, Setting the Left Position"
  alt="Example, Setting the Left Position." />

<p>In this case, the unordered list is 2,000 pixels wide. So I'm going to
move the left position to minus 2,000 pixels. What that'll do is it'll
move that entire first unordered list where it sets the correct position
for that first unordered list, so that it's entirely off the left side
of my slider window.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>Let's go ahead and do that first. I'm going to put in left position
equals and then use my tick marks and a negative sign because it's going
to be minus and then total width is going to evaluate to 2,000 pixels.
That's going to say minus 2,000 pixels right there. That puts that into
their correct place. We've got that variable set. Now what we need to do
is animate both unordered lists.</p>

<p>I'm going to animate the first one and the last one. They're going to
animate at the same time. In this list, the first line moves, the second
unordered list, the last one, the one that we added with our cloned
unordered list. It's going to move that to left zero. So that it's
moving it from the left side of that window.</p>

<p>If we come back up here to here, it's moving it from this left corner of
the window into its space here. So that's going to put that into the
correct place, whereas the second one is going to move from this space
all the way out, so that at this point, it's at minus 2000 pixels, which
will put this edge right at this edge here. You can see you're on
getting slider. You're at last, the last one, animating it. I'm
animating the left property to zero. So that will put it right, so that
the first image is right in position inside my slider at 700 using
easeInQuad, whereas the first one gets animated to left position.</p>

<p>We just set that to minus 2,000 pixels also at the same speed using the
same easing. So they move together. Let's go ahead and add this into our
script over here. I'm going to say, get my pound slider ul.last. This
one. I'm going to animate it. How am I going to animate it? I'm going to
animate the left property to zero. That one goes to zero. Left goes to
zero. I'm going to just use the same easing and everything else that I
had down here. I can even just copy and paste that to move that into
place. That moves that one.</p>

There we go. That will move both strips at the same times. Can animate

<p>So far, in our next click handler, we've checked to see if the counter
equals the image count. If it does, we have cloned the unordered list
and then added it to our slider and then set it's position into the
correct place. Then we animated the two unordered lists at the same
time, the first one and the last one. We animated the last one, it's
left position writes that the first picture is inside the window and we
animated the first one off the left side of the slider.</p>

<p>Then the last thing we need to do is after this animation is completed,
I want to remove it from the <span class="showme">DOM</span> altogether. The key word there is after
this animation is completed. That means I need a callback function. In
here, after the easeInQuad, you're going to put a comma, and add a
function like so and it's wrapping around funny and includes this
explorer here, so you can see it better.</p>

<p>But this function is a callback function that runs when this animation
has completed and that's what I want to do here. I'm going to click
inside of there and move that down. Then I can say, I want to actually
remove this first one, so I can say dollar sign, get my <b>jQuery</b>
object and say here, pound slider ul.first.remove.That will take it off
the <span class="showme">DOM</span> entirely.</p>

  alt="Example, Previous Button Click Handler." />

<p>Let's do it together and sort of see how it's actually going to work. So
the script I came up with looks like this. What's going to happen here
is when you click the previous link, the counter is going to get
documented. And then we're going to check to see if the counter is less
than 0, which means we've run through all of our images. And then we're
going to set the counter to image count -1.</p>

<p>So we've got five images and so we're going to set the counter back to
4. Remember our counter is always going to be a 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, any of
those five values, so we set it to image count minus one, so it's now a
four, then we're going to clone our unordered list and append it to the
slider, just like we did before.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 353. if previous button clicked, then ... (209) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image353.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="If previous button is clicked, then..."
  alt="If previous button is clicked, then..." />

<p>But here it will be helpful to go back and look at our diagram, once
again. Looking at our diagram, this is our situation in this part down
here our strip is at this position and we've clicked the previous
button. What we want to do is we want to add the new strip and append it
on bottom slider, instead of appending it on the top slider. Bottom
slider, left corner is going to go from -2000 pixels to -1600 pixels.
2000 because our images 400 pixels wide, we've got five of them here.</p>

<p>And that will push this first picture (blue box) into our slider. And
then the same frame will go from 0 pixels to 400 pixels to move that
there. Hopefully the diagram helps. And maybe you drew your own diagram
and trying to solve this problem.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 353. if previous button clicked, then ... (210) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"

  title="If previous button is clicked, then..."
  alt="If previous button is clicked, then..." />

<p>Here we are with our script here. But we're going to clone our own ordered 
list like we did in the previous one, but I'm going to set that last one that 
I've added into my <span class="showme">DOM</span>, the one that I've appended 
to, the slider, I'm going to set the left to minus total width again.</p>

<p>So that sets its left corner at that -2000 pixel mark. And we're going
to set left position to minus counter times image width. Remember the
counter got set to 4 here because its image count minus 1. So counter is
4. 4 times 400 gives us 1600 pixels.</p>

<p>And remember we're moving our strip from -2000 pixels to -1600 pixels to
move that left edge, that's way over off the side there into the correct
position. That's what that leftPosition is going to be set for. Then we
can take that last one and move it into the correct place. That moves
that strip onto the screen and then we take the first one and move it so
it's off the screen. And then we can, with our callback function, remove
that first one.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 354. else left position = counter * image width (211) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image354.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Else leftPosition = counter * imageWidth"
  alt="Else leftPosition = counter * imageWidth." />

<p>We’re going to do the same thing we did before and add the else and move
this stuff in here. We're going to document the counter and then we're
going to set the counter to image count -1. So that all stays the same.
Then we're going to do the thing that we did with the cloning up here so
I can actually copy this. And paste it in here. But the position is
going to be a little bit different here.</p>

<p>This position, the last one is not going to be set to <b>imageWidth</b>,
instead it's going to be set to tick marks. I'm going to put that in the
tick marks, -${totalWidth}. I want to set it to minus totalWidth, left
minus totalWidth. Then I'm going to set the leftPosition to counter
times <b>imageWidth</b> plus “px”.</p>

<p>So let's put that in next. I'm going to put that in here. But instead of minus 
totalWidth, it's going to be minus counter times <b>imageWidth</b>, that's what 
it is counter times not totalWidth but <b>imageWidth</b>. Plus “px” on the end 
of that. Now we just need to animate the two pieces and we'll do that in the 
next lesson.</p>

<p>We're going to take an unordered list that we cloned in there and
animate it into its position. And again, what we're doing is we're
moving it from one position to another. This corner when we added it to
our clone, is set to minus 2000 pixels because these are 400 pixels wide
and there's five of them.</p>

<p>Next, we're going to move it from minus 2000 pixels to minus 1600 pixels
which will move it over 400 pixels. That will push the right side of
this into our slider. We have our last element, we're animating to the
left position, and left position is now minus 1600 pixels over 700
milliseconds using easeInQuad.</p>

<p>Add this into our script. But instead of left 0, we're moving to
leftPosition. Which is that minus 1600 pixels, the counter which is four
times <b>imageWidth</b> which is 400 that's 1600, with the minus sign in
front of it and with the px that's going to move that into the correct
place.</p>

<p>That gets that one into the correct place. The other one, the first one,
this one here, I'm sorry this one here first can actually copy this
whole thing because we are going to remove it, we can come down here and
we can add that in here. But instead of moving it to
<b>leftPosition</b>, it's going to be moved to <b>imageWidth</b> which
is the width of that image.</p>

<p>So we're going to need a px on there, <b>imageWidth</b> let's do our
tick marks And then I can do ${ <b>imageWidth</b>} px like so. I believe
is that what I had over here. I have plus px I'm adding it on there, you
can do it either way with the template literally you could add the px In
there like that.</p>

<p>And then we are doing it over 700 milliseconds easeInQuad and then we've
got a callback function again to remove that first one from the list.
Let's see if it works. I'm going to save this, come back here, refresh
it, we know the next one works but does the previous one work? There's
our first slide and boom it works. There's our 5th, 4th, third, second

<p>If you choose the inspector, you can see it actually working. I've got
my slider here, I've got my unordered list inside of there, click next,
you can see that's going to minus 400 click previous. It's going to zero
when I click previous again, you'll see it, add the unordered list, move
it into place and then remove the other unordered list.</p>

<p>Now you have a slider that will work in a looping kind of way rather
than just a strip that moves back and forth. But these types of projects
in these types of lessons are helpful for thinking about different ways
and different kinds of things that you can use on your websites. And
build that will make use of jQuery, make use of the built in effects
library and teach you how to handle and think about these different

<p>Slider, using JavaScript. In the previous lesson, we worked on making a
Slider using <b>jQuery</b>, we did a couple versions of it. Here, we're
going to do the same thing using plain JavaScript without <b>jQuery</b>,
just so you can compare the syntax and see how different it is. There
will be a few little minor differences in the script, but it's very
similar to what we saw with <b>jQuery</b>. Here, the animation is going
to take place in <b>CSS</b> and we'll be using JavaScript to trigger the
animation.</p>

  style="width:50%"
  title="Final Version Sample Screen"
  alt="Final Version Sample Screen." />

<p>In the end, you should get a slide that looks like this. It's a little
bit different in that the slides are going to have some actual content
on them. The pictures will actually be in the background of the slide,
and then they're going to have little bit of a title and some text on
them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 361. basic strategy (216) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image361.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Basic Strategy"
  alt="Basic Strategy." />

<p>Let's take a look at how that set up. The basic strategy is the same and
that we're going to have a parent window that has overflow hidden set on
it. And that's going to act like a window for these slides and the
slides are all set up, in this case I have them floated. But they're all
set up to float next to each other so that they end up in one long
strip. And as you click on the buttons either left or right, the strip
of slides moves in and out of the parent window showing only one image
at a time. There's our basic strategy, very similar to what we had with
the <b>jQuery</b> version.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 362. example, html (216) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image362.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, HTML"
  alt="Example, HTML." />

<p>Now the HTML is a little bit different in this case, because instead of
the list items just having a picture in it, like what we had for the
<b>jQuery</b> slider, the list items have a div inside of it. And the
div is going to have an h2 and paragraph inside of it to create some
content on that slide. The actual picture will be in the background of
the list item, so that the list item is actually showing the picture as
a background image.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 363. example, css for the wrapper (217) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image363.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, CSS for the Wrapper"
  alt="Example, CSS for the Wrapper." />

<p>Now let's take a look at the CSS for the wrapper. The wrapper has a
width of 1000 pixels and it's set to a height of 358 pixels which is the
size of my pictures. And I'm setting margin auto on it to center it on
the screen. And then position relative because we're going to absolutely
position that string of pictures inside this window. This is the window
that's going to show only one image. And then overflow hidden so you
don't see the other pictures.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 364. markup for javascript image slider (217) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image364.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Markup for JavaScrtip image slider"
  alt="Markup for JavaScrtip image slider." />

<p>And we can come over to our code over here and see this markup in place.
You can see here I have my <b>div</b> with the <b>slider-wrapper</b>. I
have an <b>unordered list</b> with the <b>list item</b>. The <b>list
item</b> has the <b>div</b> with the content which includes an <b>h2</b>
in a picture. And I've got a bunch of these <b>list items</b> in here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 365. styles for javascript image slider (218) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image365.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Styles for JavaScrtip image slider"
  alt="Styles for JavaScrtip image slider." />

<p>On the <b>CSS</b>, you can see that I have slider up here set to width
1000 pixels and the height for the picture. And then margin auto to
center at position relative and overflow hidden.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 366. slider-wrapper with background images (218) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image366.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="slider-wrapper with background images for each"
  alt="slider-wrapper with background images for each." />

<p>Down here as you look down through the CSS here, you'll see this is
where the background images are. It's on the list items. So the first
list item gets this background image, second one gets that one. The
images are here in the folder.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 367. example, css for the slider (219) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image367.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, CSS for the slider"
  alt="Example, CSS for the slider." />

<p>The actual animation is happening in CSS. You'll see this transition
left 700 milliseconds cubic-bezier with a bunch of numbers in here. And
I'll tell you about where those come from in a minute.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 368. style for slider wrapper ul and ul li (219) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image368.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Style for slider wrapper ul and ul li"
  alt="Style for slider wrapper ul and ul li." />

<p>But we can see this in our CSS over here, right here. Using this
transition we're going to transition the left property over 700
milliseconds. That's the same as what we had in the <b>jQuery</b>
version. But this cubic-bezier, where is that coming from?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 369. cubic-bezier, easing animation tool website (220) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image369.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Ceaser, web animation tools website"
  alt="Ceaser, web animation tools website." />

<p>What I used to create those is this little web tool called
<b>Ceaser</b>, it's an animation tool. And you can see here, linear
animation.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 370. linear, easing animation tool website (220) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image370.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Linear, web animation tools website"
  alt="Linear, web animation tools website." />

<p>If I click left, it just moves it at the same speed and you can pick one
of these built in options here to see what it looks like. We can change
the amount of time. So that's starting slow and ending fast. Whereas if
you were to do <b>easeOutCirc</b> it would be the other way around,
start fast and slow.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 371. code snippet for transition left (221) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image371.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Code snippet for transition left"
  alt="Code snippet for transition left." />

<p>And then down here you can see the CSS that you actually need for this
transitional. But instead of transitioning all, I'm just transitioning
left. But you can see that that's the code that we need in order to do
this. And you can even customize this. You can drag these handles and
create your own custom using to do whatever you want it to do. And it
will adjust these numbers accordingly.</p>

<p>That's going to create the actual animation for the slides. Each time a
slide moves, this transition is going to take effect. Or each time we
change the position of the slide, the left position, this animation is
going to take effect. And that's where we we'll see the actual animation
for our slider.</p>

<p>We have a little bit more CSS to talk about before we start working on
our JavaScript. And the first thing is the actual slides themselves.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<p>The list items that are inside the unordered list that are inside the
slide wrapper, which are these elements here in my index page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="HTML div id, slider-wrapper." />

<p>These list items here. These are my actual slides. And I want to set
some styling for those. First of all, I'm going to make sure the
background image covers the entire list item. Even if they were to get a
little bit cropped, then that's fine.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 373. example, css for the slides, again (223) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, CSS for the slides, again"
  alt="Example, CSS for the slides, again." />
  
<p>I want to make sure the image covers the whole thing because it's a
background image, as we see over here. And as we mentioned before, each
slide, each list item gets its own background image.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 375. each list item has a background image (224) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Each list item has a background image"
  alt="Each list item has a background image." />

<p>Those images go in the background and they cover the background of that
list item. And then they're set to position relative because the content
that's inside these slides, this <b>div</b> with the <b>h2</b> and
<b>paragraph</b> is going to be <b>absolutely</b> positioned.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 376. test console, slider-wrapper and slider-controls (224) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="Test console, slider-wrapper and slider-controls"
  alt="Test console, slider-wrapper and slider-controls." />

<p>This div here is going to be absolutely positioned here. These are set
to position relative because those divs are positioned absolutely. And
then we set the width of the slide and the height of the slide and I
have them floated left, so they all go in a line next to each other.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 377. example, add variables (225) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="Example, Add Variables." />

<p>And now we're ready to start working on our actual JavaScript. And for
our JavaScript, in the j query version of this, we used the on method to
make sure that the window has loaded. We did an on load method, and that
was an event listener in j query to check to make sure that all those
images have loaded.</p>

<P>Here, we're just going to add an event listener with the add event
listener event and the event listener method and put it right on the
window. And we're going to check for the load event. And that will also
do the same thing where it's going to check to make sure that all the
assets have loaded before it runs the callback function. Which is the
anonymous function you see on that first line of the script there. And
everything is going to happen inside of that anonymous function that
runs after the page has loaded.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 378. add event listener to javascript (226) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Add event listener to JavaScript"
  alt="Add event listener to JavaScript." />

<p>Let's add that event listener to our script first. Come over to my
script file and I'm going to add a window, if I could type it,
window.addEventListener. And I'm looking for a load event, I'm going to
run a function that runs when the page has loaded all of its content. In
here I'm going to add a number of variables. A lot of these variables
are going to look familiar, because it's very similar to what we did
with our jQuery version of the script. Also, this function here will
function as a closure for this whole script.</p>

<p>I don't have to worry about adding an IIFE immediately invoked function
expression, because this function will make sure all the variables,
everything in here are local to this function. And nothing will be
leaking into the global scope. We don't need to worry about doing that
for the script either, because we're putting it in this event listener
for when the page loads.</p>

<p>What do I need to know? I need to know how many slides I have? How wide is each 
slide? What is the total width of the slider? And then I need to get some elements 
that I'm going to work with on my page, the actual slider element itself. If I 
make a variable called slider, I don't have to type 
<span class="showme">document.querySelector</span> every time I want to work 
with the slider, same thing with the next button and the previous button.</p>

<p>Let's add these in over here. I'm going to go back to my script over here 
and type it in. I'm going to make a variable called slideCount, and I'm going 
to use <span class="showme">querySelectorAll</span> to get the length of how 
many list items do I actually have?</p>

<p>The next thing I need to know is how wide is each slide (slideWidth)? And 
there's a property in JavaScript called <span class="showme">offsetWidth</span>. 
I can go get this wrapper and say, well how wide is my slider-wrapper? The next 
thing I'm going to need is the total slider width (totalWidth), which is going
to be the slide count and it's the slide with the pixels. Then I need my 
<span class="showme">DOM</span> elements; the slider itself, the next button 
and the previous button.</p>

<p>We're going to need a few more variables to get before we get started
with our next click handler. Okay, here are a few more variables that we
need. We need to know the leftPosition and set it to 0. We need a
counter, and then we want to set the slider.style.width to the totalWidth.</p>

<p>In our last lesson, we got some basic variables in place for our slider

<p>We're setting that locally in the style here and over here, if I come in
and look at my slider and refresh this, and then click “Inspect”. I
should see in here for the unordered list and actual number of pixels
here, UL style with 5,000 pixels, because I've got five slides and
they're 1,000 pixels wide, so that's 5,000 pixels. The reason why I want
to set that here is just in case I add more slides to my slider. I could
add more if I wanted to or remove some if I wanted to and I want to keep
the script as general as possible.</p>

<p>Over in the css for this, in here I have probably, I think I have 5,000
pixels set here, I have it set here. I could remove that from here if I
wanted to know. I don't really need it here, it's getting set on that
element manually with an inline style and JavaScript is setting that, so
I don't really need it here. Really I don't want it here I want it to be
handled by the script because I want to be able to add or remove
elements here and the script is going to override that anyway, so it's
not even really necessary to have it there. That's a nice thing to pay
attention to and to realize that I can take that out of there.</p>

<p>The next thing we need to do is set up our event handler for when you
click the next button. The first thing we'll do is handle an event for
what happens when you click the link will pass in the event object and
prevent default so that you don't get the little hashtag for clicking
the next link up in the URL. We will increment the counter and then
we're going to have any if and else for if the counter is equal to the
slide count, in which case we'll set the counter to zero, we'll set the
left position to zero, and then we'll move the slider into position.
Otherwise, we're going to just move the slider to the next slide.</p>

<p>Let's set up this event listener on our next button. Go back to my
script here and now I can just use the handy shortcut next because I
know that that is actually from here it's going in and getting my button
pound next. Next, add EventListener. I'm listening for a click and I'm
going to run a function when you get a click, like so. Then I'm going to
pass in evt. It represents that event object that we're passing into
this function. The event that happens when you click on this next
button. Then we're going to do evt.preventDefault.</p>

<p>That's because these buttons over here are really just links. If you
click on the link without that, then this pound sign ends up in the URL,
this hash and I don't really like that. The event prevent default, keeps
that from happening, evt prevent default passing in that thing.</p>

<p>Then we're going to have an if statement, if will handle what happens if
the counter has gotten to the end of the line and in else. We also need
to increment the counter. Counter is the same as slide count equals,
equals the same as. Read that as the same as. Don't forget, we need to
increment the counter, counter plus, plus. It's the same as counter
equals counter plus one. Just a nice little shortcut there. Then if
counter is the same as slide count, then we're going to do something in
here and then we've got an else in there. Then we'll pick up the rest of
this next EventListener in the next lesson.</p>

  alt="Style slider-wrapper ul, transition left." />

<p>Now remember over here on the styles, when we talk about slider, we're
talking about this unordered list here and it has the transition on it,
so that's going to take care of the animation, I don't have to do the
animation over here.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="slider.style.left = leftPosition"
  alt="slider.style.left = leftPosition." />

<p>All I have to do is set that position left and CSS will handle the
animation. That's one thing that's different between the JavaScript
version and the jQuery version. In the jQuery version, we're using the
jQuery animate method, which is using the built-in effects library for
doing the animation. Here, we're just setting the CSS position of the
CSS property to leftPosition, which in this case is zero, and then we
let CSS handle the animation.</p>

<p>Because CSS uses the GPU instead of the CPU, it's nice and buttery
smooth. It'll work well on older devices that don't have a faster
processor. In newer device the jQuery will work fine, but older devices,
the CSS in particular will work a little bit better and be a little bit
smoother, but I think it's even smoother on newer devices, honestly.
That takes care of the if statement here.</p>

<p>For the else, we need to increment the slide forward, if we're not at
the end, we're just going to move that slide forward. I'm going to set
left position here. LeftPosition. I'm going to use a pair of tick marks
and I'm going to set it to a 'negative number', and what I want it to go
to whatever the counter is times the slide width. I'm going to put in
here dollar sign curly brace counter.</p>

<p>If I'm clicking it the first time that counters going to go from zero to
one, that's going to be one, and then when I multiply it times slide
width. Of course, I want to add a px in here. That sets that left
position there. Then I just need slider.style.left = leftPosition.</p>

  title="Sample screen, slide title over image"
  alt="Sample screen, slide title over image." />

<p>Let's go check it out. Notice it's nice and smooth with the animation.
When I get to the end, it goes back to the beginning. We have a script
that's working and this is perfectly fine the way it is, but it could be
simplified a little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 397. slider left position = leftposition (238) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image397.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="slider left position = leftPosition"
  alt="slider left position = leftPosition." />

<p>If we look at this, you'll notice this line is the same as this line,
and if I set the counter to zero, I don't need to explicitly set left
position to zero because this will do the same thing.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 398. if counter = slidecount, then... (238) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image398.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="If counter = slideCount, then reset to zero"
  alt="If counter = slideCount, then reset to zero." />

<p>If I could set counter to zero, zero times slide width px, is going to
be zero, I don't really need this line either. In fact, my if statement
could get much shorter, It could just be if counter is zero, counter is
the same so I can set counter to zero, and then I don't really need an
else because this is going to happen no matter what. If you wanted to
make the script even shorter, you could put these on one line, I think
Visual Studio Code is going to scream at me when I try to do this and
put those back in two lines as soon as I save this.</p>

<p>But you could even just put this all in one line. It makes this really
nice and short and compact where setting the event prevent default, we
increment the counter. If the counter is the same as slide count, we set
the counter to zero and then we set the left position to whatever the
counter is times the slide width. If it's zero, then it's going to be
zero, and that's fine. If it's one, then it's going to be one times side
width 1,000 pixels minus 1,000 pixels, so on and so forth. Then we set
the slider style left to left position and let the CSS do the animation.</p>

<p>Your challenge was to write the event handler for the previous button.
Hopefully, you gave it a try and were able to do it. If not, let's do it
together here. But it's good to at least try, even if you tried and got
stuck and couldn't quite get it to work, then that's fine. We want to
make sure we try these things because that's the way you learn
JavaScript, and then now we'll try to do it together.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 402. on click, prevent default, decrement counter (241) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="On click, prevent default, decrement counter"
  alt="On click, prevent default, decrement counter." />

<p>The first thing I'm going to do is copy this entire event listener and
paste it. A lot of it's the same. I'm going to say next, instead of
next, it's going to be previous to go with my previous variable here,
which is getting my prev element from my HTML.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 403. index.html, id is prev (241) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image402.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="index.html, id is prev"
  alt="index.html, id is prev." />

<p>Over here in the HTML, you can see that I set the previous button to id
prev. I'm getting previous, click evt.PreventDefault. Instead of
incrementing the counter, we're going to decrement it minus minus. Now I
need to think about this. If the counter is less than 0, I want to set
the counter to slideCount minus one. Remember, slideCount will give me a
full number of slides. In this case, there's five, so that's going to be
five. But I want my counter to be a zero, a one, a two, a three, or a
four, those five numbers.</p>

<p>Then the left position is going to be the same. It should be all I need
to do to make this work. Let's see if it works. I'm going to save that
and come back to my slider and refresh. The next button should still
work. Previous button works. If I click Previous again, it goes to the
end of the slides, and then it will backup through my slides. When I get
to the first slide, if I click "Previous", it goes to the end, click
Next and it goes to the beginning.</p>

<p>You've completed this project. Here on this slide, you can see the full script with 
everything in it that we needed. You can see I left the else statements in here, I don't 
really need this, this is actually the longer version of it. We've got a full version of 
that script and you could use this on your websites and compare this to what we did with 
the jQuery versions.</p>

<p>Now if you want a challenge, try to make the version of the JavaScript slider work 
where the slides don't go all the way back to the beginning or go all the way back to 
the end when you get to the end, make it so that it wraps around to the second version 
of the jQuery script but just with JavaScript. Hopefully, that will work.</p>

<p>I have a few scripts that we can look at that will explain how

fun methods to play with because you can do a lot of really interesting
things with them. Occasionally, you do want something to run after a
certain amount of time has happened or on some interval. This is where
we can really get into how to do that with JavaScript.</p>

  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example, Two Functions for Timers in JavaScript"
  alt="Example, Two Functions for Timers in JavaScript." />

<p>Essentially, there are two functions in JavaScript that allow us to set 
<b>timers</b>. One is <b>setTimeout()</b> and the other one is <b>setInterval()</b>. 
Each of these functions takes a <b>callback</b> function and an amount of time. For 
<b>setTimeOut()</b> or for <b>setInterval()</b>, you will run a function and then 
you'd put a comma and then the amount of time that you want to have a lapse before 
it runs or on the interval.</p>

<p>For example, down here I have <b>setTimeout</b> <b>wakeUp</b>. So it'd run 
this function <b>wakeUp</b> after eight hours or <b>setInterval eatMeal</b>, 
after every four hours I'm getting <b>eatMeal</b>, something like that. Now, you 
can't pass in eight hours and four hours, you pass in a number that represents 
milliseconds but it's that basic idea.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 414. example #1, using the setinterval function (247) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  src="./images/image414.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Example #1, Using the setInterval Function"
  alt="Example #1, Using the setInterval Function." />

<p>Let's take a look at our script here. We have a <b>timer</b> that is a variable 
and it's assigned the <b>setInterval()</b> function. If you remember, this is called 
a function expression because in JavaScript, JavaScript treats functions as 
first-class citizens within JavaScript.</p>

<p>You can assign a function to a variable just the same way you could assign a 
string to a variable or a number to a variable or anything else to a variable, 
any other piece of data, you can assign a function to a variable. That's one of 
the things that's very powerful about JavaScript, it allows us to assign functions 
to variables. I've assigned this set interval method to the variable timer and 
then the <b>setInterval</b> method has a function in it and the function simply
says, take the <b>div.innerHTML</b>, and plus equal the content.</p>

<p>We'll take some content and add it into the <b>div</b> and then we'll do that 
every 1,500 milliseconds or every 1.5 seconds. That's how this is adding the 
content onto the page is that timer loads, and <b>setInterval</b> immediately 
starts running and starts doing its thing and adding this content in the page.</p>

  alt="Using setInterval and innerHTML, append paragraph." />

<p>Let's go look at the script again in the actual file over here. I have
the <b>content</b> here, which is adding another <b>paragraph</b>, it's
just a string here and then <b>setInterval</b> runs and it says take
<b>theDiv</b>, <b>getElementByID(‘theDiv’)</b>.</p>

<p>It's got some default content and it's going to set its <b>innerHTML</b>
to <b>content</b>. In 1.5 seconds, the content is going to get switched
to a <b>paragraph</b> and it's going to add that. It's going to set the
<b>innerHTML</b> to that <b>content</b>. Then in another 1.5 seconds, it
will take the content and add it again. Now, there's two
<b>paragraphs</b> in the <b>content</b> and it's going to change the
<b>innerHTML</b> and <b>div</b> to having the two <b>paragraphs</b> so
the two <b>paragraphs</b> are on the page, and so on and so forth until
the page is completely full with the paragraphs. We'll talk about the
<b>clear interval method</b> in the next lesson.</p>

<p>We've already talked about how this example is using <b>setInterval</b>
to keep adding <b>content</b> into the <b>div</b> and then adding these
<b>paragraphs</b> onto the page. We have <b>setInterval</b> assigned to
this variable timer, and down here I have an <b>event listener</b> that
when you click this button, clearInterval timer and stop.</p>

<p>It's got an <b>EventListener</b> and when you click on it, it runs a
function, and the function runs this method, <b>clearInterval</b> and
I'm passing in <b>timer</b>. Timer holds the <b>setInterval</b> thing
here. That's what allows me to stop the script.</p>

<p>Up here, when I refresh my page, it'll automatically start adding
content into that div. When I click stop the script, then that
<b>EventListener</b> fires and it runs a function with
<b>clearInterval</b> in it and then stops that script. It clears the
interval timer. Now, we don't need to use the function expression here.</p>

<p>If I come back here and refresh, you'll see it will continue to work in

<p>In order to stop the script, I have to have this thing set to some
variable so that I can pass that variable into <b>clearInterval</b> over
here. The other option would be to put <b>setInterval</b> inside there,
but then you need something to get it started. In order to clear the
interval, I need to assign my <b>setInterval</b> to timer, is really
that bottom line here in order to make that work.</p>

<p>Now there's one other thing that I'd like to be clear about with this
script before we finish. If I go back here and right-click and choose
inspect, what I would like you to notice is that all of these paragraphs
are highlighting every time the script runs in my inspector here, and
that's because of the way the script is running. It's not just adding a
<b>paragraph</b> to what was there before. It's replacing the entire
contents of the <b>div</b> with all of the <b>paragraphs</b> every
second and a half.</p>

<p>That's something to pay attention to because it might not be the best in
terms of performance to replace all of the contents, and we could make
it so that it's just adding to the div with an append method, we could
append to the <b>div</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> every second and a half,
and that might be a better way of running the script.</p>

<p>But I thought that it was interesting to point out that what's happening
here is that every second and a half, our variable, the <b>content</b>
is getting an extra paragraph in it. The first time it runs as one
<b>paragraph</b> in it, the second time it runs, it's got two
<b>paragraphs</b> in it. The third time it runs, it's got three
<b>paragraphs</b> in it, and so on. Then each time <b>setInterval</b>
runs, it's taking however many <b>paragraphs</b> are there and putting
them inside the <b>div</b> using <b>innerHTML</b>. So it's an important
way of understanding how this one works. In the next lesson, we'll take
a look at the next example.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what's going on with this example. I'm going to go
over to my code example 2. Down here I have a <b>div</b> with a class of
<b>one</b> on it. That class is setting that <b>div</b> to be a 100
pixels tall by 100 pixels wide with the background color of red. Notice
the transition is here on the classes. Transitional two seconds.
<b>setTimeout</b> runs. Since we're running this function here.</p>

<p>What this function is doing is it's setting the class attribute to
<b>two</b>, but it's not doing it for 2,000 milliseconds for two
seconds. As soon as this class gets attached to it, then this class
becomes active. The animation happens in the size and all that in the
background color, everything gets transitioned.</p>

<p>Second of all, you can use JavaScript to add a class or change a class
on an element and when it gets that new class, it then applies all of
the declarations or rules within that class.</p>

<p>That's cool because it means you could have elements on your web-page
and then after a certain amount of time or when a user does something,
you can apply a class to it and change that element based on the styling
associated with that class. It could have an animation in there.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the JavaScript that makes this work. If I come back
here, I open <b>example3.html</b>. You can see again I have a <b>div</b>
(<b>id=“thediv”</b>) with the <b>class</b> of “<b>one</b>” on it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 436/437. set current class to 'one', run classrotator (257) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  title="run classRotator to change class"
  alt="run classRotator to change class." />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Down here, I've got, <b>getElementById(“thediv”)</b>, I've got a
variable called <b>currentClass</b>, which is set to “<b>one</b>”. Then
I've got a function called “<b>classRotator</b>'', which checks to see
if the <b>currentClass</b> is”<b>one”</b>. I'm going to
<b>setTimeout</b> and I'm going to run a function that's going to run
after a two second delay. In this function, I'm going to take the
<b>div</b> and set the class name to “<b>two”</b>. Then I'm going to set
<b>currentClass</b> to “<b>two”</b>. In a nutshell, if it's not
“<b>one</b>”, then it must be “<b>two</b>” and set <b>currentClass</b>
over a two second delay.</p>

<p>But notice that this function is running <b>classRotator</b>. Recursive
function is a function that calls itself and this is an example of a
function that calls itself.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 438. initialize with classrotator() (258) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image438.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Prime recursion process with classRotator()"
  alt="Prime recursion process with classRotator()" />

<p>To kick off that function entirely, we have to run it once down here.
When the page loads, it runs this once, but then when it runs itself, it
either runs itself again in the if statement or it runs itself again in
the ‘else’ statement in the <b>setTimeout</b>.</p>

<p>Now, recursion is a very powerful thing and it's easy with recursion to
get confused or to do something that will cause your script to run out
of memory and to run crazy and wild.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 439. be careful with recursion (258) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image439.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Be careful with recursion, classRotator"
  alt="Be careful with recursion, classRotator." />

<p>For example, if I took <b>classRotator</b> and stuck it outside of the
<b>setTimeout</b>, it would run very quickly and it would keep running
itself and then it would start to get stacked up and eventually you'd
run out of memory. You'd get a heap overflow error showing that
basically JavaScript has run out of memory.</p>

<p>That can happen very easily when you're working with recursive scripts
but when handled properly, recursion can be a very powerful feature. Not
only that, it can be the preferred way of working with data and working
with <b>setTimeout</b> or <b>setInterval</b>. If, for example, you're
going out to the world and getting a piece of data from somewhere and
then doing something when it comes back. Usually recursion is the better
way to go because you can wait until it's come back before you try to do
something with it.</p>

<p>Whereas if you use <b>setInterval</b>, then you're more likely to try to
do something before you get your data back. <b>setInterval</b> will run
every x amount of seconds. <b>setTimeout</b> will wait at least two
seconds, but maybe longer, depending on where something is in the stack
of things to run with JavaScript. We will get more into the event loop
in JavaScript and talk more about how that works and why it is like that
in a later lesson.</p>

<p>I've got two classes and this function is calling itself, but it's only
calling itself after two seconds is lapsed, either here, in the “if” or
here, in the “else if”. That gives us this very interesting pulsating,
creepy circle that feels like it's breathing on our web page and you can
do more stuff with that if you wanted to.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we'll convert one of the slide shows that we did in the
previous module, so that it runs on a timer without having to click the
Next and Previous buttons. Basically, so that it runs automatically. You
could pick any of the three that we did in the previous lesson, or if
you figured out how to take the JavaScript only one and make it run on a
never ending loop. You could use that one, you could use any of them.</p>

<p>I'm going to use this slider here that loops around and goes in any
direction this way. But I'm going to make this one run on a timer. Now,
before you follow my lesson and follow these videos showing you how to
do it, I strongly encourage you to try to do it for yourself. It's not
that hard and see if you can figure it out. To do that, get rid of the
buttons, delete the buttons off the screen.</p>

<p>You can delete the CSS that has to do with the buttons off the files,
and then modify the script that's using <b>setInterval</b> or
<b>setTimeout</b> using recursion, you can make it work either way. As
an added challenge, make it so that when the user hovers their mouse
over the slides, the slider stops. Then when they move their mouse off
of it, it starts again.</p>

runs it over 3 thousand seconds. What I'm going to do instead is I'm
going to make a function down here, function called, Slider.</p>

<p>I'm going to put the guts of this anonymous function, this one here,
inside of that function instead. I'm going to take all of this stuff
that I had moved into there, all the way down to here. I'm going to cut
it. Now we're back to just set interval with the anonymous function in
it and comma 3 thousand back to where we were before. I'm going to put
all that stuff in here instead, inside of this function here. I've got
my counter and all of this stuff inside here.</p>

<p>Then here I'm going to say run slider, and this is a reference to my
function slider. We want to wait 3 seconds and then run Slider, so then
it's going to go find the function Slider and run. That should work in
terms of exactly the same thing that we had before.</p>

<p>The difference now is that I can set my setInterval here. I can assign
that to a variable. I could put, "let my slider equal set Interval
slider." Then I can create an <b>eventListener</b> that will do
something when the mouse hovers over it. I'm going to make an
<b>eventListener</b> for when you hover over this element on my page
here.</p>

<p>Down here I'm going to do<b>document.getElementByID(slider.addEventListener)</b> 
and when the <b>addEventListener</b> runs. I'm going to be looking for mouse 
over, when you mouse over I'm going to run a function. When you mouse over
that element, the Slider, I'm going to say, clear interval, mySlider,
and that will stop it from running.</p>

<p>Now I've cleared my interval and it's not going to advance the slides.
Now I need one that will actually advance the slides when I roll off.
Coming back here, I can actually copy this. Get interval, slider
addEventListener, mouse out. I'm going to run a function, and what am I
going to run? I'm going to say Slider. I'm going to just do this again,
so I can actually just copy that.</p>

<p>This is why I used Let up there instead of constants because a
reassigning this variable. In order to reassign it, I need to be able to
set it to Let up there. Now if I set that to set interval slider, when I
mouse out, sliders now going to have set interval on it again and that
should run. Now set interval has been cleared and it's no longer
advancing the slides. But then if I roll off of it and wait three
seconds, it should start back up again.</p>

<p>Look at that, it's working perfectly. Hopefully you were able to solve
those two challenges. If not, I recommend going through this a few
times, do it on your own a few times. Create your own Slider, or create
your own script where you can play around with set interval and set
timeout.</p>

<p>The best way to learn JavaScript is to keep practicing with it and to
keep challenging yourself by making small experiments, taking a small
script that you have, and then extend on it and see if you can make it
do a little bit more.</p>

<p>What else could you do? Could you make it so that it has the buttons for
advancing the slides manually, but it goes automatically when you're not
using the buttons. But then when you do use the buttons, it moves it
manually. That would be an interesting modification to the script. Maybe
you can come up with other ideas and other things that you could do.</p>

<p>The finished version of the project will give you a quote that rotates
around two different quotes after a period of time. And this is
potentially very useful you could put this on a website to rotate
customer testimonials.</p>

<p>I wrote this script myself because a client needed on his website to to
make something that rotated testimonials and this is way back in the
early 2010s. So a lot of these scripts hadn't been written were easily
accessible at that point, so I had to write one myself.</p>

  title="Example, Project Setup"
  alt="Example, Project Setup." />

<p>Let's take a look at how this is set up so we can actually work with it.
The project setup is really simple, we have a page with a div with four
quotes in it and you could add quotes or remove quotes and put in more
if you wanted to. And basically the quotes will all get set so that
they're hidden so that the div is empty to begin with. Then the first
paragraph fades in over two seconds, it stays on the screen for seven
seconds so you can read it and then it fades out over two seconds.</p>

<p>Then the next paragraph fades in, waits seven seconds and then fades
out. After the last paragraph fades out we want to go back and fade in
the first paragraph and repeat the process indefinitely, so this is a
really great job for recursion. We'll also be making use of the
<b>jQuery</b> affects library a little bit along with some of the other
features we've talked about in this course. I hope you have fun with it
and end up with a script that you could use for something, it's pretty
fun.</p>

  alt="Example, Script Diagram." />

<p>I have this diagram that can help us simplify it and think about exactly
how this is going to work. When the script starts it's going to set a
counter to one and then it's going to run a function called
<b>contentRotator</b>.</p>

<p>And then on the right here I have that function contentRotator and it
starts, it fades in the first paragraph that matches the counter number
to begin with it's counter number one. And then it asks, is it the last
paragraph on the page? If it is then we're going to wait seven seconds,
fade the paragraph out and set the counter back to one. If it's not then
we're going to wait seven seconds fade the paragraph counter out and
then increment the counter. And then we run this function again, we run
content rotator again and that's where the recursion comes in. This
function is going to call itself and we'll be using a set time out.</p>

<p>We're going to fade the paragraph in and then we're going to wait seven
seconds, so there's a set time out where we wait for seven seconds and
then we're going to fade the paragraph out. That's where the set time
out will go, is when we're waiting seven seconds.</p>

<p>Let's get started on the script, the first thing to note on this script and 
I have my files open here in Visual Studio Code here. And the first thing to 
note is that in the CSS I have all the paragraphs inside my container, so here's 
my <b>div id</b> container, they're all set to display none. Now, when you look 
at this it might look a little bit weird because of these things here, but this 
is just an html entity that's creating a curly quote.</p>

<p>That's the left double quote and then this one over here creates the right 
double quote and then this one in here creates an mdash. In design typography 
it is very important and rather than just, I could just put the straight up and 
down quotes but those don't look as good. And since I want this to look a little 
bit nicer, I'm putting in the curly quotes and the mdash, which is the longer 
dash rather than the end dash or the hyphen. And if you take a typography course 
at some point you'll learn all about these different glyphs that we can use when 
we're creating content.</p>

<p>The quote button on the American keyboard anyway, can really represents six 
different possible characters. There's the straight up and down, double quote, 
the left curly quote, the right curly quote and then the same thing for the 
single quotes. There's a straight up and down single quote, left, single curly 
quote and right single curly quotes, that's six characters in one key. And other 
languages may have other characters associated with that as well but for English 
it's actually six characters.</p>

<p>Our next job is to get our first paragraph and faded it in. We'll use
our <b>counter</b> to do that. And the CSS and child filter to allow us
to get the first paragraph because remember currently all the paragraphs
are set to display none.</p>

<p>We can use our <b>jQuery</b> object to get that first paragraph and
fade it in. Down inside <b>contentRotator</b>. We want to use
<b>jQuery</b> object to get them. I’m going to use tick marks to say
pound container, P and child parentheses. Now, if I were to put a one in
here that would go get the first paragraph. If I were to get a two, that
would get second paragraph, that would get a third paragraph. So on and
so forth, you might wonder why we didn't start my counter with zero. And
frequently we do when we're working with arrays because the first
element in the array zero indexed.</p>

<p>The <b>nth child pseudo selector</b> is actually indexed with <b>one</b>. One 
will get the first paragraph, but I don't want to put a one in there. I want to 
put the variable <b>counter</b> so I can do my template literal like so and put 
the variable <b>counter</b>. And that will go get <b>counter</b> which is a one 
in this case the first time this runs. That gets the first paragraph and 
fades in 2,000 (2 secons) because this is <b>jQuery</b> effects library here. So 
we can feed in that first paragraph there.</p>

<p>Now that I have faded the paragraph in. I need to wait seven seconds and
this is going to happen after the two second fade in. Remember with
<b>jQuery</b> we have a <b>callback</b> function that we can use with
our fade in helper method that will allow us to do something after it
has faded in.</p>

<p>So after that animation has run, we want to run that <b>callback</b>
function. We want to run this function after the fade in is complete,
and that's where we're going to put the rest of our script. Everything
else we do is going to go inside this <b>callback</b> function.</p>

sometimes this is referred to as <b>callback</b> hell. But this is the

<p>Now in here what we're going to do is increment the <b>counter</b>,

<b>contentRotator</b> runs itself when the <b>counter</b> is set to two,
it'll check to see if it's the last child, if it's not, it'll increment

<p>Since it's so important to understand this, I'm actually going to type
it again, so in here I'm going to add setTimeout again and setTimeout
runs a function over a certain amount of time, in this case, seven
seconds, like so. It's going to run this function over seven seconds.
It's going to wait seven seconds before it does this function. In here
and this part I will copy and paste just to make sure I get it right.
Just this piece here. I'm going to say, okay, go into my container and
get that <b>p: nth-child counter</b>, which in this case it's the last
one. Should be four in this examle.</p>

<p>Get that one and then I'm going to do <b>fadeOut</b> over two seconds,
2,000. Then I'm going to run another <b>callback</b> function. Again, I
have to wait until those two seconds are over before I can do this, and
here the one thing that's different from what I did below is the
<b>counter</b> gets set to one, so I'm setting it back to my first
paragraph. Then I'll run <b>contentRotator</b> another time, but now
with the paragraph counter set to one.</p>

<p>In summary, hopefully through this project, you saw that you can use
callback functions, <b>timers</b>, and recursions to make something like
this content rotator work without a tremendous amount of code,
especially in combination with <b>jQuery</b> and the built-in effects
library, like the fade in and fade out. Although it would be interesting
to make the same script work without <b>jQuery</b>, that would be a good
challenge for you.</p>

<p>See if you can do that or what else could you make work with this
script? The script is fading content in and out and we're right now
we're fading in and out paragraphs on our HTML here, but it really could
be anything, and I could add paragraphs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 494. rotator.html - quoted paragraphs (287) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image494.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Quoted paragraphs in rotator.html"
  alt="Quoted paragraphs in rotator.html." />

<p>That's another thing is that this will handle an unlimited number of
paragraphs. I could just keep adding paragraphs in here in the script
tool, just work, that's kind of nice, but what if it wasn't paragraphs,
whatever it was, pictures or block quotes or other types of content that
got rotated in and out. You could rotate anything and you'll see how you
would need to modify the script to make that work.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 495. rotator.js - lines 1-21 (287) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="displayed"
  src="./images/image495.png"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:50%"
  title="Lines 1-21 of rotator.js"
  alt="Lines 1-21 of rotator.js." />

<p>Other things that are exciting about recursion in general. The way recursion 
works is that you could make a recursive function that takes parameters and you 
could run that recursive function passing in different parameters each time it 
runs. That makes recursion very interesting and very different than just a 
simple loop, because you could run the same program, but the program could do 
something different each time that it runs and that's very interesting to think 
about.</p>

<p>Think about what you can do with that. There's a lot of really fun projects 
you could make where using recursion, where after a certain amount of time, the 
function runs itself again, but with a different set of parameters. You could 
even use the random function to pass in random parameters so that you don't 
know what you're going to get each time the function runs itself and that can 
be very interesting.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Congratulations for making it to the end of our second course on JavaScript 
in our four-course specialization. You've learned a lot of JavaScript so far, 
as well as tackling <b>jQuery</b> and <b>jQuery</b> animation and animation 
using CSS and JavaScript, we've created some fun interactive elements you can 
put on real websites. I think you've learned a lot and you should be proud of 
yourself. Congratulations for making it this far, and I look forward to seeing 
you in our third course on JavaScript, <b>"Interactivity with JavaScript and 
jQuery"</b>.</p>
<p>We will get even deeper into the <b>jQuery</b> library, <b>jQuery</b> plugins, 
we'll create some more sophisticated scripts and some more complex scripts so 
that you can develop your skills and get better at JavaScript. I look forward to 
seeing you there.</p>
